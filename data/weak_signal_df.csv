Among various interventions, food fortification and supplementation with micronutrients have been proven to be cost-effective. The aim of the present paper is to review existing literature to assess risks of excessive intake in LMIC to then highlight programmatic changes required to maximise benefits of micronutrient interventions while minimising risks of adverse effects. While very few LMIC have national food consumption surveys that can inform fortification programmes, many more are implementing mandatory fortification programmes. The risks of inadequate micronutrient intakes were common, but risks of excessive intakes were also present for iodine, vitamin A, folic acid and iron. Excessive salt consumption, high concentrations of iodine in ground-water and excessive levels of iodisation were linked with excessive iodine intake. For vitamin A, overlapping interventions were the main risk for excessive intake; whereas for iron, contamination with iron from soil and screw-wares of millers and high iron concentration in drinking-water increased the risk of excessive intake, which could be further exacerbated with fortification. Before implementing micronutrient interventions, adherence to the basic principles of documenting evidence confirming that the deficiency in question exists and that fortification will correct this deficiency is needed. This can be supported with dietary intake assessments and biochemical screening that help diagnose nutrient deficiencies. Targeting micronutrient interventions, although programmatically challenging, should be considered whenever possible. Moreover, closer monitoring of appropriate fortification of foods and overlapping interventions is needed.', 'Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) has serious public health consequences including morbidity and mortality for populations in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially for children under 5 years and pregnant women. LMICs are at greater risk of VAD, in part due to low levels of consumption of vitamin A-rich foods most of which are plant-based, such as orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP), with lower bioavailability than animal sources of the vitamin A. Food-based approaches such as biofortification of OFSP, including promoting the consumption of vitamin A-rich biofortified staple crops, has been shown to be potentially effective in improving the status of vitamin A and other micronutrients. This study examined vitamin A-rich food consumption and its predictors among women of reproductive age from OFSP-growing households in two regions of Uganda.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted among 617 OFSP growing households, focusing on women in the reproductive age group from the northern and eastern regions of Uganda. Households were not receiving any VAD-related intervention at the time of the survey. Quantitative data included vitamin A-rich food consumption, knowledge on vitamin A, and rich food sources dietary intake, using a 7-day food frequency questionnaire. Vitamin A consumption and risk of deficiency were estimated using the Hellen Keller International guide.\nThe majority of women in this study were either pregnant (80%) or lactating (17%). More than 70% of the study population had a weighted vitamin A rich food consumption mean score of <6 days per week, indicating a high risk of VAD. Knowledge about vitamin A [b (SE) = -0.18 (0.50), \nComponents of food insecurity such as availability, affordability, utilization, and changing food preferences may contribute to the unexpected inverse relationship between knowledge and consumption of vitamin A rich foods. Scaling up biofortified food initiatives, including OFSP, can improve consumption of vitamin A rich foods with effective strategies to comprehensively address consumption barriers such as lack of nutrition education, cooking skills, and storage facilities, as well as low production levels and perceived contamination of biofortified foods.', 'The Western Desert Kidney Health Project (WDKHP) aimed to determine the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), kidney disease and associated risk factors in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in a remote area of Western Australia.\nThe project, featuring whole-of-community cross-sectional surveys and health assessments using point-of-care testing, was conducted in five small towns and six remote Aboriginal communities in the Goldfields of Western Australia between 2010 and 2014. Initial health assessments were completed by 597 adults (424 Aboriginal) and 502 children (393 Aboriginal). This included almost 80% of the Aboriginal population. All non-Aboriginal people residing in the six remote Aboriginal communities participated.\nRisk factors for renal disease and T2DM were present in participants of all ages, including children as young as 2 years. There was no significant difference between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal adult participants had twice the burden of T2DM than the standard Australian population. More than 12% of all children had elevated albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). Adults had markers of kidney disease at higher rates than expected: 51% of Aboriginal adults and 27% of non-Aboriginal adults had at least one marker of kidney disease (haematuria, proteinuria or elevated ACR). Aboriginal women were the highest risk group (32% T2DM, 40% elevated ACR). Haematuria and low urine pH were common findings, 21% of people had haematuria (greater than trace) and 71% had urine pH of 6 or less; there was no difference in this finding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.\nThe WDKHP found higher than expected rates of risk factors for T2DM and renal disease compared with Australian Bureau of Statistics rates for Australian Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal adults and children, with Aboriginal women the highest risk group. The rates for non-Aboriginal participants were higher than expected, suggesting exposures in common might be more important than ethnicity.The high prevalence of aciduria and haematuria found in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants in this study suggests that factors contributing to a chronic metabolic acidosis and inflammation or irritation of the urinary tract need to be explored. Drinking water quality in this remote area is known to be poor and may be an important contributing factor. Many of the contributing factors are potentially modifiable - such as water quality, food supply, exercise opportunities and living conditions - offering scope for interventions to reduce the risk and burden of these diseases.']"

The drinking water should be free from urine and stool contamination. Coliform test is popular for understanding feces contamination. However, understanding urine contamination in drinking water is a difficult task. On the other hand, urine contamination can cause disease like leptospirosis. It occurs mainly in animals and infects humans through contaminated water, food, and soil and causes serious consequences. Rat urine is the most common source of such disease outbreaks. Further, sophisticated laboratories with high-end technologies may not be present at the site of disease outbreaks. In this context, we have proposed a spectrofluorimetric approach to screen urine contamination in water. The screening method can sense up to 156 nl/ml of rat urine.', ""Microbial contamination management is a crucial task in the food industry. Undesirable microbial spoilage in a modern food processing plant poses a risk to consumers' health, causing severe economic losses to the manufacturers and retailers, contributing to wastage of food and a concern to the world's food supply. The main goal of the quality management is to reduce the time interval between the filling and the detection of a microorganism before release, from several days, to minutes or, at most, hours. This would allow the food company to stop the production, limiting the damage to just a part of the entire batch, with considerable savings in terms of product value, thereby avoiding the utilization of raw materials, packaging and strongly reducing food waste. Sensor systems offer major advantages over current systems as they are versatile and affordable but need to be integrated in the existing processing systems as a process analytical control (PAT) tool. The desire for good selectivity, low cost, portable and usable at working sites, sufficiently rapid to be used at-line or on-line, and no sample preparation devices are required. The application of biosensors in the food industry still has to compete with the standard analytical techniques in terms of cost, performance and reliability."", 'Healthcare-associated infections (HCAI/HAI) represent a substantial threat to patient health during hospitalization and incur billions of dollars additional cost for subsequent treatment. One promising method for the detection of bacterial contamination in a clinical setting before an HAI outbreak occurs is to exploit native fluorescence of cellular molecules for a hand-held, rapid-sweep surveillance instrument. Previous studies have shown fluorescence-based detection to be sensitive and effective for food-borne and environmental microorganisms, and even to be able to distinguish between cell types, but this powerful technique has not yet been deployed on the macroscale for the primary surveillance of contamination in healthcare facilities to prevent HAI. Here we report experimental data for the specification and design of such a fluorescence-based detection instrument. We have characterized the complete fluorescence response of eleven clinically-relevant bacteria by generating excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) over broad wavelength ranges. Furthermore, a number of surfaces and items of equipment commonly present on a ward, and potentially responsible for pathogen transfer, have been analyzed for potential issues of background fluorescence masking the signal from contaminant bacteria. These include bedside handrails, nurse call button, blood pressure cuff and ward computer keyboard, as well as disinfectant cleaning products and microfiber cloth. All examined bacterial strains exhibited a distinctive double-peak fluorescence feature associated with tryptophan with no other cellular fluorophore detected. Thus, this fluorescence survey found that an emission peak of 340nm, from an excitation source at 280nm, was the cellular fluorescence signal to target for detection of bacterial contamination. The majority of materials analysed offer a spectral window through which bacterial contamination could indeed be detected. A few instances were found of potential problems of background fluorescence masking that of bacteria, but in the case of the microfiber cleaning cloth, imaging techniques could morphologically distinguish between stray strands and bacterial contamination.']"

In the Middle-East, studies investigating food contamination and dietary exposure to mycotoxins are particularly scarce. This study aims at evaluating the dietary exposure of an adult Lebanese urban population to four mycotoxins (AFB1, AFM1, OTA, DON) classified as priority food contaminants by the WHO. Dietary exposure assessment was performed by means of the total diet study approach. Average and excessive consumer exposure estimates (p95) were calculated and compared with appropriate toxicological reference values (TRVs). Average dietary exposure levels to OTA and DON represented 29.9% and 156.8% of the respective TRVs, with the p95 exposure estimates approaching or exceeding the TRVs for these mycotoxins (95.1% and 355.8%, respectively). Based on the mean dietary exposure level to AFB1, cancer risk was estimated at 0.0527-0.0545cases/100,000persons/year, while mean exposure to AFM1 was associated with a population risk of 0.0018-0.0027cases/100,000persons/year.

On the other hand, researchers try to find biologic methods to remove/mitigate mycotoxins in food and feed using bio-products. But the research works concerning legislations and mycotoxin risk assessment still rare. Therefore, it appears necessary to make review on the current status of mycotoxins in North African countries in order to explore data related to contamination of basic food in this region and to highlight the problem to the policy-makers to establish a serious legislation on this matter.

This study characterized the occurrence of AMR in Escherichia coli from bivalve molluscs and assessed for the possible sources in the Hillsborough river complex of Prince Edward Island, Canada in areas overlapping with an oyster fishery. Multivariable statistical analysis indicated that the probability of detecting E. coli increased as the estimated dosage of animal effluent contamination decreased. Isolates with AMR were only found from sampling sites closest to untreated human effluent sources. Twenty-seven percent (n=6 of 22) of the isolates were pathogenic, with virulence factors consistent with extraintestinal E. coli of human origin. Though there is more evidence of contamination arising from human effluent, more research is needed to identify driving sources.', 'Antimicrobial resistance in bacteria associated with food and water is a global concern. To survey the risk, 312 Escherichia coli isolates from shrimp farms and markets in Thailand were examined for susceptibility to 10 antimicrobials. The results showed that 17.6% of isolates (55 of 312) were resistant to at least one of the tested drugs, and high resistance rates were observed to tetracycline (14.4%; 45 of 312), ampicillin (8.0%; 25 of 312), and trimethroprim (6.7%; 21 of 312); 29.1% (16 of 55) were multidrug resistant. PCR assay of the tet (A), tet (B), tet (C), tet (D), tet (E), and tet (G) genes detected one or more of these genes in 47 of the 55 resistant isolates. Among these genes, tet (A) (69.1%; 38 of 55) was the most common followed by tet (B) (56.4%; 31 of 55) and tet (C) (3.6%; 2 of 55). The resistant isolates were further investigated for class 1 integrons. Of the 55 resistant isolates, 16 carried class 1 integrons and 7 carried gene cassettes encoding trimethoprim resistance (dfrA12 or dfrA17) and aminoglycosides resistance (aadA2 or aadA5). Two class 1 integrons, In54 (dfrA17-aadA5) and In27 (dfrA12-orfF-aadA2), were found in four and three isolates, respectively. These results indicate a risk of drug-resistant E. coli contamination in shrimp farms and selling places. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant E. coli carrying tet genes and class 1 integrons indicates an urgent need to monitor the emergence of drug-resistant E. coli to control the dissemination of drug-resistant strains and the further spread of resistance genes to other pathogenic bacteria.', ""Limited studies have investigated the microbial diversity of wild marine mammals.\nThis study characterized Escherichia coli isolates collected from fresh faecal samples of endangered southern resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) located by detection dogs.\nWGS of each strain was done to determine ST (using MLST), clonotype (C:H), antimicrobial resistance and virulence profile. Conjugation experiments were done to determine the mobility of the tet(B) tetracycline resistance gene.\nAll isolates belonged to extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) clonal lineages ST73 (8/9) and ST127 (1/9), often associated with human community-acquired urinary tract disease. Clonotyping using fumC and fimH alleles showed divergence in clonal lineages, with ST73 isolates belonging to the C24:H10 clade and the ST127 isolate belonging to C14:H2. The eight ST73 isolates carried multiple acquired antibiotic resistance genes, including aadA1, sul1 and tet(B), encoding aminoglycoside, sulphonamide and tetracycline resistance, respectively. Conjugative transfer of the resistance gene tet(B) was observed for three of the eight isolates. ST127 did not carry any of these acquired resistance genes. Virulence-associated genes identified included those encoding adhesins (iha, papC, sfaS), toxins (sat, vat, pic, hlyA, cnf1), siderophores (iutA, fyuA, iroN, ireA), serum survival/protectins (iss, ompT), capsule (kpsM) and pathogenicity island marker (malX).\nOrca whales can carry antibiotic-resistant potentially pathogenic strains of E. coli. Possible sources include contamination of the whale's environment and/or food. It is unknown whether these isolates cause disease in southern resident killer whales, which could contribute to the ongoing decline of this critically endangered population.""]"

A cross-sectional study was designed with a semi-structured questionnaire and observation checklist that collected information about hygiene practices from 320 consenting meat-handlers by interviewer-administered technique. Data was entered in EpiData and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21. Descriptive statistics of frequency distribution were used to report meat hygiene-practices and other independent variables, with multivariate logistic regression to establish predictors of meat hygiene-practices at 5% level of significance. The study revealed that less than half (44.4%) of the meat handlers had satisfactory meat hygiene practices. The adjusted regression analysis showed, strong evidence (p<0.01) of association of higher education level (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.7-4.5), other occupational involvement (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.9-2.4), and being officially registered (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.2-6.8) with meat hygiene practices. However, there was fair evidence (p<0.05) of association between shorter duration of meat being processed to sale (AOR = 0.57, P = 0.042) and meat hygiene practices. In this study, the satisfactory meat hygiene practices of meat handlers was low. The educational level, registration status of shops, involvement in other jobs, and awareness on meat hygiene were identified as key factors associated with meat hygiene practices. Thus, these factors need to be considered while developing programs to improve meat hygiene practices among the meat handlers. Meat handlers should be provided with training and orientation program for improving the meat hygiene practices.', 'Pork safety is an important public health concern in Vietnam and is a shared responsibility among many actors along the pork value chain. We examined the knowledge, perceptions, and practices regarding food safety, disease, and health risk among selected pork value chain actors (slaughterhouse owners and workers, people living around slaughterhouses, pork sellers, consumers, and veterinary and public health staff) in three districts in Hung Yen Province, Vietnam. We randomly selected 52 pork value chain actors to be surveyed through questionnaires, observation checklists, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. Most slaughterhouse workers acquired knowledge and experience of food safety through ""learning by doing"" rather than from training by a veterinary or public health professional. Both slaughterhouse worker and pork seller groups had some accurate perceptions about pig diseases and foodborne diseases; however, misperceptions of risk and, especially, of zoonoses were present. Furthermore, while workers and sellers often use cloths to dry the meat and clean equipment, they did not think this was a risk for meat contamination. Moreover, when sellers wear protective equipment, such as gloves, masks, or hats, consumers perceive that the sellers may have health issues they are trying to conceal and so consumers avoid buying from them. The perceived freshness of pork, along with trust in the seller and in the pork production process, were strong indicators of consumer preference. And yet, pork value chain actors tend to trust their own individual food safety practices more, rather than the practices of other actors along the chain. Veterinary and public health staff emphasized the gap between regulations and food safety practices. Education and training on food safety risks and proper handling are priorities, along with integrated and intensive efforts to improve food safety among pork value chain actors.', 'Inadequate facilities and hygiene at slaughterhouses can result in contamination of meat and occupational hazards to workers. The objectives of this study were to assess current conditions in slaughterhouses in western Kenya and the knowledge, and practices of the slaughterhouse workers toward hygiene and sanitation.\nBetween February and October 2012 all consenting slaughterhouses in the study area were recruited. A standardised questionnaire relating to facilities and practices in the slaughterhouse was administered to the foreperson at each site. A second questionnaire was used to capture individual slaughterhouse workers\' knowledge, practices and recent health events.\nA total of 738 slaughterhouse workers from 142 slaughterhouses completed questionnaires. Many slaughterhouses had poor infrastructure, 65% (95% CI 63-67%) had a roof, cement floor and walls, 60% (95% CI 57-62%) had a toilet and 20% (95% CI 18-22%) had hand-washing facilities. The meat inspector visited 90% (95% CI 92-95%) of slaughterhouses but antemortem inspection was practiced at only 7% (95% CI 6-8%). Nine percent (95% CI 7-10%) of slaughterhouses slaughtered sick animals. Only half of workers wore personal protective clothing - 53% (95% CI 51-55%) wore protective coats and 49% (95% CI 46-51%) wore rubber boots. Knowledge of zoonotic disease was low with only 31% (95% CI 29-33%) of workers aware that disease could be transmitted from animals.\nThe current working conditions in slaughterhouses in western Kenya are not in line with the recommendations of the Meat Control Act of Kenya. Current facilities and practices may increase occupational exposure to disease or injury and contaminated meat may enter the consumer market. The findings of this study could enable the development of appropriate interventions to minimise public health risks. Initially, improvements need to be made to facilities and practices to improve worker safety and reduce the risk of food contamination. Simultaneously, training programmes should target workers and inspectors to improve awareness of the risks. In addition, education of health care workers should highlight the increased risks of injury and disease in slaughterhouse workers. Finally, enhanced surveillance, targeting slaughterhouse workers could be used to detect disease outbreaks. This ""One Health"" approach to disease surveillance is likely to benefit workers, producers and consumers.']"

This profusion of data may advance our understanding of human exposure, yet constitutes an interpretive challenge to toxicologists and food safety regulators. Despite these advances in analytical science, the basic problem of the extreme heterogeneity of mycotoxin contamination, although now well understood, cannot be circumvented. The real health challenges posed by mycotoxin exposure occur in the developing world, especially among small-scale and subsistence farmers. Addressing these problems requires innovative approaches in which analytical science must also play a role in providing suitable out-of-laboratory analytical techniques.', 'Citrinin (CIT), a mycotoxin known to exert nephrotoxicity, is a contaminant in food and feed.

Adding to the challenge is the highly resistant nature of these biofilm growths and the need to keep in mind that any antimicrobials utilized in these situations risk health implications with human consumption of the products that are being processed in these locations. For that reason, the ideal means of sanitizing areas of foodborne biofilms would be natural means.

The BLS P34 showed inhibitory effect against all planktonic cells of E. faecalis. The inhibition of biofilm formation and the eradication of pre-formed biofilm were evaluated with the crystal violet assay and with the reduction of 3-bromide [4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium.

Rhamnolipids (RL) have attracted attention as candidates to replace synthetic surfactants, exhibiting high surface activity combined with its microbial origin, biodegradability, and low toxicity. In this work, an RL biosurfactant was evaluated regarding its ability to disrupt or remove S. aureus biofilms established on polystyrene plates using nutrient broth and skim milk as the growth media. Rhamnolipid treatment was performed at different surfactant concentrations and temperatures. Rhamnolipid removes up to 88.9% of milk-based biofilms, whereas for nutrient medium 35% removal was attained. The RL concentration affects the disruption of nutrient medium-based biofilms. High carbohydrate content of milk-based biofilms favors disruption by RL and the organization of RL molecules in solution showed a predominance of aggregates from 1 to 10 and 100 to 1,000 nm in all conditions studied. Biofilm disruption activity of RL is nutrient-specific and dependent on biofilm matrix composition. Staphylococcus aureus biofilms established in milk were significantly reduced using RL at low concentrations and temperatures. These findings suggest potential application of RL in milk (dairy) processing industries where low temperatures are applied.']"

Packaged ice is commercially produced and can be easily found in grocery and convenience stores. However, the quality and safety of packaged ice products is not consistent. The Packaged Ice Quality Control Standards manual (PIQCS) published by the International Packaged Ice Association provides the quality and processing standards for packaged ice produced by its members. Packaged ice produced on the premise of stores (on-site packaged ice) is not required to be in compliance with these standards. In this study, packaged ice produced by manufacturing plants or by in-store bagger (ISB) machines and on-site packaged ice were compared for their microbiological quality and microbial diversity. Our results revealed that 19% of the 120 on-site packaged ice samples did not meet the PIQCS microbial limit of 500 CFU/mL (or g) and also the absence of coliforms and Escherichia coli . Staphylococci were found in 34% of the on-site packaged ice samples, most likely through contamination from the packaging workers. None of the ISB and manufactured packaged ice samples had unacceptable microbial levels, and all were devoid of staphylococci. Salmonella was absent in all samples analyzed in this study. Microbial community analysis of ice based on 16S/18S rRNA targeted sequencing revealed a much higher microbial diversity and abundance in the on-site packaged ice than in the ISB ice. Proteobacteria, especially Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, were the dominant bacterial groups in all samples tested. Most of these bacteria were oligotrophic; however, a few opportunistic or potential pathogens were found at low levels in the on-site packaged ice but not in the ISB packaged ice. The types of microbes identified may provide information needed to investigate potential sources of contamination. Our data also suggest a need for enforcement of processing standards during the on-site packaging of ice.']"

Of all the methods available for sterilization, high-pressure steam sterilization such as autoclaving is the most widely used. While autoclave sterilization minimizes pathogen contamination, it can dramatically impact both structural and biological properties of biomaterials. It has recently been reported that injectable cryogels with shape memory properties hold great promises as 3D macroporous biomimetic scaffolds for biomedical applications including tissue engineering. In this study, the impact of autoclave sterilization on properties of a series of cryogels is measured. Unlike conventional hydrogels, cryogels made of natural polymers demonstrate a strong resilience to autoclave sterilization. This process does not alter either their macrostructural or unique physical properties including syringe injectability. The scaffolds' bioactive sites are preserved and autoclaved cryogels retain their excellent cytological compatibility post-autoclaving. Furthermore, autoclaved cryogels do not trigger a notable activation of primary murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells suggesting a minimal risk for biomaterial-induced inflammation, which is further confirmed by an in vivo histologic analysis. In summary, these results further demonstrate the huge potential of cryogels in the biomedical field and their capacity to be translated into clinical applications.""]"

The 11 pesticide pollution sources were collected from the five systems of fruit, leaf, soil, groundwater, and honey based on a systematic review in medlar planting site. Seventy-six samples were analyzed by chromatography technique. Residues of 4 (36.7%) compounds were found in the samples.

There is also evidence of direct use of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on food crops and detection of DDT residues in surface water, soil and human breast milk. Those reported risks might be due to lack of knowledge among farm workers, negligence of farm owners, absence of post-registration monitoring systems and poor implementation of both national and international regulations in Ethiopia due to poor institutional capacity.\nThe health and environmental risks of inappropriate use of pesticides requires action by all concerned bodies.

More specifically, nickel can leach from contact materials to foods or drinks before their consumption by humans. In recent years, the European Food Safety Authority expressed concern regarding the chronic and acute exposure of the European population to nickel. This study aimed to screen foods available on the Belgian market for their nickel content and to identify potential sources of the contamination. In total, 708 samples were collected from three different main categories of foods, including plant-based products, animal-based products and drinks. Elevated nickel concentrations were found in plant-based products such as chocolate, legumes, nuts, figs, peanut butter, chocolate spreads and breakfast cereals. The nickel concentrations in the animal-based products and drinks were significantly lower compared to the plant-based products. In the beer samples, no correlation between the alcohol percentage and nickel concentration was found. Higher nickel concentrations were found in the tea drinks in comparison to other drinks. Furthermore, the effect of packaging, e.g. storage in cans, on the final nickel concentration of the foods was investigated. No effect of the packaging was found, demonstrating that leaching of nickel from packaging materials is not significantly contributing to the nickel content in foods.

Finally, the case of NDMA generation in Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and ranitidine were compared in an attempt to address the circumstances leading to the current contamination.']"
