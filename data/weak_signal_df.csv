Limited information exists on the co-occurrence of microbes of food safety concern and the factors associated with their presence. Here, a population-based repeated cross-sectional design was used to determine the prevalence and co-occurrence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp. and Vibrio spp. in key food commodities - chicken, pork, prawns, salmon and leafy greens. Prevalence in 1,369 food samples for these four target bacterial genera/species varied, while 25.6% of all samples had at least two of the target bacteria and eight different combinations of bacteria were observed as co-occurrence profiles in raw prawns. Imported frozen chicken was 6.4 times more likely to contain Salmonella than domestic chicken, and imported salmon was 5.5 times more likely to be contaminated with E. coli. Seasonality was significantly associated with E. coli and Klebsiella spp. contamination in leafy greens, with higher detection in summer and autumn. Moreover, the odds of Klebsiella spp. contamination were higher in summer in chicken and pork samples. These results provide insight on the bacterial species present on foods at retail, and identify factors associated with the presence of individual bacteria, which are highly relevant for food safety risk assessments and the design of surveillance programmes.', 'Ready-to-eat (RTE) food sold in Quetta, Pakistan was assessed for microbial contamination.\nEqual numbers of samples were collected from four categories of RTE food - burgers, shawarma, pizza and sandwiches - from January 2018 to December 2018. Microbial contamination of individual food samples was assessed by quantifying the total aerobic count obtained from plating samples on bacterial growth medium. Salmonella spp. serovars were identified using polymerase chain reaction.\nApproximately 38% (121/320) of RTE food samples were not fit for human consumption. The most contaminated type of RTE food was shawarma (49%). Microbial contamination of food samples was higher in summer compared with the other seasons. Approximately 40% (49/121) of food samples that were not fit for human consumption were contamined with Salmonella spp. Salmonella enteritidis (69%) and Salmonella typhimurium (31%) were the only serovars among the samples testing positive for Salmonella spp. Of the 49 samples with high microbial counts, S. enteritidis was present in 34 samples and S. typhimurium was present in 15 samples. The antibiotic sensitivity results demonstrated that both S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium were resistant to amoxicillin. In addition, S. enteritidis was resistant to chloramphenicol and erythromycin, and S. typhimurium presented high resistance to erythromycin. Both S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis were highly sensitive to kanamycin.\nRTE food sold by street vendors in Quetta was found to be contaminated with Salmonella spp. and poses a great health risk to consumers. As such, consumption should be avoided, and the health authorities should take stringent action to ensure the quality of street food in order to reduce the healthcare burden.', 'Food-borne pathogens are the leading cause of illness and death in developing countries, killing approximately 1.8 million people annually. In developed countries, food-borne pathogens are responsible for millions of cases of infectious gastrointestinal diseases each year, costing billions of dollars. The objective of this study was to screen for two major food-borne pathogens, Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., from meat samples obtained from different strata of the consumer market in Jeddah.\nA total of 60 meat samples, 20 each from large hypermarkets, groceries and small butcher shops were used in the study. Samples were transported to the laboratory in a cooler. They were macerated in peptone water and then seeded on selective media appropriate for each organism. Colonies were identified using conventional microbiological methods and suspected colonies were confirmed as E. coli and Salmonella spp. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers.\nThe results indicated a high degree of contamination in samples from butcher shops as compared to those from groceries or hypermarkets (high scale supermarkets). Both pathogens E. coli and Salmonella spp. were found in higher rates in the samples from butcher shops. In small butcher shops, E. coli was found at an incidence of 65%, and Salmonella at 45%.\nThe results indicate an urgent need for applying proper food hygienic practices in food outlets, especially in small ones, to reduce the incidence of food-borne diseases. Vigilance by the right agencies must be implemented in order to prevent future food-borne outbreaks.']"

Such growth failure has dire consequences in the short (increased mortality) and long-term (loss of human capital and increased risk of chronic diseases). Food interventions before 6 months will increase morbidity/mortality through contamination in settings of poor sanitation and hygiene. Waiting to improve nutrition only after the initiation of complementary feeding at 6 months is a missed opportunity and may permanently alter life trajectory and potential. This underscores the importance of maternal nutrition. Iron and folic acid and protein energy supplementation during pregnancy are interventions that can improve maternal nutrition and birth outcomes. Maternal supplementation during lactation should be considered as a means to improve maternal and child outcomes, although the evidence needs strengthening. Support and counseling are also required to improve maternal diets and promote exclusive breastfeeding. Programs focused on improving maternal nutrition across the continuum of preconception, pregnancy and lactation are likely to have the greatest impact as mothers are central gatekeepers to the health and future of their children.', 'Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) has serious public health consequences including morbidity and mortality for populations in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially for children under 5 years and pregnant women. LMICs are at greater risk of VAD, in part due to low levels of consumption of vitamin A-rich foods most of which are plant-based, such as orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP), with lower bioavailability than animal sources of the vitamin A. Food-based approaches such as biofortification of OFSP, including promoting the consumption of vitamin A-rich biofortified staple crops, has been shown to be potentially effective in improving the status of vitamin A and other micronutrients. This study examined vitamin A-rich food consumption and its predictors among women of reproductive age from OFSP-growing households in two regions of Uganda.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted among 617 OFSP growing households, focusing on women in the reproductive age group from the northern and eastern regions of Uganda. Households were not receiving any VAD-related intervention at the time of the survey. Quantitative data included vitamin A-rich food consumption, knowledge on vitamin A, and rich food sources dietary intake, using a 7-day food frequency questionnaire. Vitamin A consumption and risk of deficiency were estimated using the Hellen Keller International guide.\nThe majority of women in this study were either pregnant (80%) or lactating (17%). More than 70% of the study population had a weighted vitamin A rich food consumption mean score of <6 days per week, indicating a high risk of VAD. Knowledge about vitamin A [b (SE) = -0.18 (0.50), \nComponents of food insecurity such as availability, affordability, utilization, and changing food preferences may contribute to the unexpected inverse relationship between knowledge and consumption of vitamin A rich foods. Scaling up biofortified food initiatives, including OFSP, can improve consumption of vitamin A rich foods with effective strategies to comprehensively address consumption barriers such as lack of nutrition education, cooking skills, and storage facilities, as well as low production levels and perceived contamination of biofortified foods.', 'Micronutrient deficiencies are widespread and disproportionately affect women and children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Among various interventions, food fortification and supplementation with micronutrients have been proven to be cost-effective. The aim of the present paper is to review existing literature to assess risks of excessive intake in LMIC to then highlight programmatic changes required to maximise benefits of micronutrient interventions while minimising risks of adverse effects. While very few LMIC have national food consumption surveys that can inform fortification programmes, many more are implementing mandatory fortification programmes. The risks of inadequate micronutrient intakes were common, but risks of excessive intakes were also present for iodine, vitamin A, folic acid and iron. Excessive salt consumption, high concentrations of iodine in ground-water and excessive levels of iodisation were linked with excessive iodine intake. For vitamin A, overlapping interventions were the main risk for excessive intake; whereas for iron, contamination with iron from soil and screw-wares of millers and high iron concentration in drinking-water increased the risk of excessive intake, which could be further exacerbated with fortification. Before implementing micronutrient interventions, adherence to the basic principles of documenting evidence confirming that the deficiency in question exists and that fortification will correct this deficiency is needed. This can be supported with dietary intake assessments and biochemical screening that help diagnose nutrient deficiencies. Targeting micronutrient interventions, although programmatically challenging, should be considered whenever possible. Moreover, closer monitoring of appropriate fortification of foods and overlapping interventions is needed.']"

Two hundred fifty-three Salmonella isolates serotyped as 4,[5]:i:- during the period 2008-2011 in Belgium and originating from animal productions, food or human clinical samples were analysed by a specific duplex PCR. One hundred ninety-four isolates (76.7%) fit the profile of a S. Typhimurium monophasic variant as defined by the European Food Safety Authority. The other isolates possessed but did not express the phase II flagellin gene (23.3%).

Cardinal values and growth/no growth boundaries were determined in broth, while artificial spore inoculations were performed in dough for various pan bread recipes to compare experimental counts with in silico growth simulations. Finally, two storage scenarios were tested to determine the probability to reach a spoilage threshold during bread shelf-life. Similarly to the safety criteria fixed for Listeria monocytogenes contamination in foodstuff complying with EC regulation, a potential rope spoilage threshold was arbitrary fixed at 5 log CFU/g for B. amyloliquefaciens. This study further underlines a higher rope spoilage potential of the ISPA strains as compared to the ATCC strain, thus emphasizing the interest to characterise both wild strains and reference strain to account for biological variability.

To date, actions have been focused on stringent hygienic practices prior to production, namely periodical sanitization of the processing equipment and lines. Not only does optimum sanitization require in-depth knowledge on the type and source of contaminants, but also the heat resistance of microorganisms is unique and often dependent on the heat transfer characteristics of the low-moisture foods. Rheological properties, including viscosity, degree of turbulence, and flow characteristics (for example, Newtonian or non-Newtonian) of both liquid and semisolid foods are critical factors impacting the flow behavior that consequently interferes heat transfer and related control elements. The demand for progressively more accurate prediction of complex fluid phenomena has called for the employment of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model mass and heat transfer during processing of various food products, ranging from drying to baking. With the aim of improving the quality and safety of low-moisture foods, this article critically reviewed the published literature concerning microbial survival in semisolid low-moisture foods, including chocolate, honey, and peanut butter. Critical rheological properties and state-of-the-art CFD application relevant to quality production of those products were also addressed. It is anticipated that adequate prediction of specific transport properties during optimum sanitization through CFD could be used to solve current and future food safety challenges.', 'Large, renowned outbreaks associated with low-moisture foods (LMFs) bring to light some of the potential, inherent risks that accompany foods with long shelf lives if pathogen contamination occurs. Subsequently, in 2013, Beuchat et al. (2013) noted the increased concern regarding these foods, specifically noting examples of persistence and resistance of pathogens in low-water activity foods (LWAFs), prevalence of pathogens in LWAF processing environments, and sources of and preventive measures for contamination of LWAFs. For the last decade, the body of knowledge related to LMF safety has exponentially expanded. This growing field and interest in LMF safety have led researchers to delve into survival and persistence studies, revealing that some foodborne pathogens can survive in LWAFs for months to years. Research has also uncovered many complications of working with foodborne pathogens in desiccated states, such as inoculation methods and molecular mechanisms that can impact pathogen survival and persistence. Moreover, outbreaks, recalls, and developments in LMF safety research have created a cascading feedback loop of pushing the field forward, which has also led to increased attention on how industry can improve LMF safety and raise safety standards. Scientists across academia, government agencies, and industry have partnered to develop and evaluate innovate thermal and nonthermal technologies to use on LMFs, which are described in the presented review. The objective of this review was to describe aspects of the extensive progress made by researchers and industry members in LMF safety, including lessons-learned about outbreaks and recalls, expansion of knowledge base about pathogens that contaminate LMFs, and mitigation strategies currently employed or in development to reduce food safety risks associated with LMFs.']"

In the present study, 109 filamentous fungi were isolated from various spoiled dairy products and dairy production environments. The isolates were identified through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. In spoiled products, Penicillium and Cladosporium were the most frequent genera of filamentous fungi and were also present in the dairy environment, indicating that they may represent a primary source of contamination. For dairy production environments, the most frequent genera were Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Nigrospora. Four species (Hypoxylon griseobrunneum, Rhinocladiella similis, Coniochaeta rosae, and Paecilomyces maximus) were identified for the first time in dairy products or in dairy production environment. Phytopathogenic genera were also detected, such as Montagnula, Clonostachys, and Riopa. One species isolated from the dairy production environment is classified as the pathogenic fungi, R. similis.

Molecular identification methods, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and clone-specific genotyping were used to analyze recent and historical isolates, and a case-case study was performed. Isolates from thirty cases (26 fungemias, 22 associated deaths at day 30) were collected between September 2011 and October 2012. Eighteen cases occurred within 8 weeks (outbreak) in 10 health care facilities, suggesting a common source of contamination, with potential secondary cases. Phylogenetic analysis identified one clade (clade A), which accounted for 16/18 outbreak cases. Results of microbiological investigations of environmental, drug, or food sources were negative. Analysis of exposures pointed to a medical device used for storage and infusion of blood products, but no fungal contamination was detected in the unused devices. Molecular identification of isolates from previous studies demonstrated that S. clavata can be found in dairy products and has already been involved in monocentric outbreaks in hematology wards. The possibility that S. clavata may transmit through contaminated medical devices or can be associated with dairy products as seen in previous European outbreaks is highly relevant for the management of future outbreaks due to this newly recognized pathogen. This report also underlines further the potential of WGS for investigation of outbreaks due to uncommon fungal pathogens.\nSeveral cases of rapidly fatal infections due to the fungus Saprochaete clavata were reported in France within a short period of time in three health care facilities, suggesting a common source of contamination. A nationwide alert collected 30 cases over 1 year, including an outbreak of 18 cases over 8 weeks. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to analyze recent and historical isolates and to design a clade-specific genotyping method that uncovered a clone associated with the outbreak, thus allowing a case-case study to analyze the risk factors associated with infection by the clone.

Escherichia coli was identified in 6.7% of the surface samples, while Salmonella spp. was found in 3.3% of the surface samples and 8.6% of raw material samples. Virulence genes were detected in Salmonella spp. isolates. One Salmonella spp. isolate was resistant to sulfonamide, while one E. coli isolate was multiresistant, including the presence of resistance genes sul2, strA, strB, tetA and tetB. The presence of coliforms demonstrates failings in hygienic-sanitary procedures. The presence of pathogenic microorganisms causing foodborne diseases in the production line indicates persistent contamination in the production plant. Although the drying process applied to beef jerky should guarantee the safety of the final product, the presence of multiresistant pathogenic microorganisms, presenting virulence genes, should be a matter of concern. Because beef jerky is a ready-to-eat product, a failure in the production process may cause such microorganisms to pose a public health risk.', 'The aim of this study is to trace the possible relations between the hygienic status of slicing utensils and the microbiological quality of pastrami.\nA total of 75 pastrami retail markets were visited in Kayseri, Turkey, where the pastrami (a ready-to-eat meat product) is commonly produced and consumed. Sliced pastrami, the cutting board and knife surface swabs were collected from each pastrami retail point to trace possible sources of contamination.\nSamples were analysed for the presence of total viable counts (TVC), total coliforms, Escherichia coli, members of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria spp. In addition, pastrami samples were analysed for sulphite-reducing Clostridium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii.\nWhen compared with the target values of related literatures, a total of 6 (8%) pastrami samples were found unsatisfactory as a result of TVC (5.3%), Enterobacteriaceae (5.3%), E. coli (2.6%), S. aureus (2.6%), Listeria spp. (2.6%) and Listeria monocytogenes (1.3%) contaminations. No T. gondii positivity was observed among the pastrami samples. None of the cutting board and knife surface swabs were found to harbour TVC level >10\nMore emphasis needs to be placed for training of food handlers and to apply good hygienic practices at the point of pastrami sale. The conditions at retail points must be monitored and inspections should be tightened to protect public health.', 'Undercooked ground beef is regularly implicated in food-borne outbreaks involving pathogenic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli. The dispersion of bacteria during mixing processes is of major concern for quantitative microbiological risk assessment since clustering will influence the number of bacteria the consumers might get exposed to as well as the performance of sampling plans used to detect contaminated ground beef batches. In this study, batches of 25kg of ground beef were manufactured according to a process mimicking an industrial-scale grinding with three successive steps: primary grinding, mixing and final grinding. The ground beef batches were made with 100% of chilled trims or with 2/3 of chilled trims and 1/3 of frozen trims. Prior grinding, one beef trim was contaminated with approximately 10']"

If the food items are not stored under adequate conditions, a post harvest contamination may also occur. Animals and humans take them up by food items and some of them are stored and accumulated in different tissues and organs, so that food of animal origin may be contaminated, too. Especially aflatoxin and ochratoxin are secreted into milk by consumers of contaminated food. Since milk represents the major food source of newborns and infants, they are notably exposed to these mycotoxins. This health risk for these individuals may be of particular importance, because their ability to metabolize these fungal toxic agents is not yet fully developed at this stage.', 'Citrinin (CIT), a mycotoxin known to exert nephrotoxicity, is a contaminant in food and feed. Since CIT contamination is not regularly analyzed, data on its occurrence and especially levels in food commodities are insufficient for conducting a conventional exposure assessment. Yet, human biomonitoring, i.e., an analysis of CIT and its metabolite dihydrocitrinone (DH-CIT) in urine samples allows to estimate exposure. This study investigated CIT exposure in young (2-14 years) and adult (24-61 years) residents of three federal states in Germany. A total of 179 urine samples from children and 142 from adults were collected and analyzed by a targeted LC-MS/MS based method for presence of CIT and DH-CIT. At least one of the biomarkers was detected and quantified in all urines, which indicated a widespread dietary exposure to the mycotoxin in Germany. Interestingly, the biomarker concentrations of CIT', 'Citrinin (CIT) deserves attention due to its known toxic effects in mammalian species and its widespread occurrence in food commodities, often along with ochratoxin A, another nephrotoxic mycotoxin. Human exposure, a key element in assessing risk related to food contaminants, depends upon mycotoxin contamination levels in food and on food consumption. Commercial supplements, commonly designated as red rice, usually used in daily diets in Asiatic countries due to their medicinal properties, may pose a health problem as a result of high CIT levels. In addition to the worldwide occurrence of CIT in foods and supplements, a wide range of several analytical and detection techniques with high sensitivity, used for evaluation of CIT, are reviewed and discussed in this manuscript. This review addresses the scientific literature regarding the presence of CIT in foods of either vegetable or animal origin, as well as in supplements. On what concerns analytical methodologies, sample extraction methods, such as shaking extraction and ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE), clean-up methods, such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), solid phase extraction (SPE) and Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuECHERS), and detection and quantification methods, such as thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), biosensors, and ELISA, are also reviewed.']"

For this reason, food is considered another source of NTM transmission for humans. The aims of this study were to evaluate the microbiological quality and the occurrence of NTM in fresh-squeezed orange juice samples purchased from street vendors. All 102 samples analyzed were positive for aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB), with limits ranging from 1.8 to 6.2 log CFU/ml. A total of 55 (54%), 25 (25%), and 13 (13%) orange juice samples were positive for total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), and Escherichia coli , respectively. TC, FC, and E. coli were present with limits ranging from <3 to >1,100 most probable number (MPN)/ml, <3 to 460 MPN/ml, and <3 to 11 MPN/ml, respectively. Six orange juice samples harbored NTM. These NTM were identified by using three molecular markers (hsp65, rrs, and rpoB genes) and corresponded to the fast-growing mycobacteria: Mycobacterium fortuitum (n = 3), Mycobacterium rhodesiae (n = 1), Mycobacterium obuense (n = 1), and a mixture of M. fortuitum and Mycobacterium mucogenicum in an additional sample (n = 1). No correlation was found between the presence NTM in orange juice samples with the presence and concentration of the indicator microorganisms (aerobic mesophilic bacteria, TC, and FC). Overall, these results suggest that fresh-squeezed orange juice might represent a vehicle for NTM transmission in humans. Therefore, prevention of contamination by humans (proper handling and washing of oranges) during juice preparation should be recommended.', 'Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) compose a group of mycobacteria that do not belong to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group.

Human disease is acquired from environmental exposures and through consumption of NTM-contaminated food. The most common clinical manifestation of NTM disease in human is lung disease, but lymphatic, skin and soft tissue, and disseminated disease are also important.

Rapid industrialization and urbanization are the dominant sources of anthropogenic soil-food chain contamination with PTEs. The intent of current study was to investigate the interactive levels of Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn in soil and their accumulation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) samples collected from 96 sites including industrial, urban, and peri-urban areas of a leading multi-industrialized center (Faisalabad) of Pakistan. According to results obtained from present study, non-carcinogenic (HQ) and life-time carcinogenic risks (CR) of the PTEs to the local inhabitants were estimated following the risk assessment modals proposed by the US-EPA. With respect to estimated HQ for chronic non-carcinogenic risk of Mn, Ni, and Pb, higher potential hazards were observed as compared to Cu, Fe, and Zn. Meanwhile, the carcinogenic risk of Ni marginally exceeded the limit described by US-EPA for adults. Overall, the health risks of PTEs with the consumption of wheat were lower than the limits described by US-EPA except for Ni. However, continuous consumption of this PTEs contaminated food may result the potential buildup of poisonousness and various disorders in humans. Therefore, long-term monitoring and gastrointestinal bio-accessibility studies are requisite for the safety of humans under such conditions.', 'Soils impacted by metallurgy activities pose serious risks to the health of exposed populations, whether by ingestion of soil or contaminated food and water.

Our data demonstrated that the environmentally available concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn in soils surrounding the Pb smelting plant are among the highest that have been reported. Apart from Cd, sequential extraction demonstrated that most metals are in recalcitrant forms in the soil. However, the daily exposure of children to Pb, Zn, Cd, and As exceeded the acceptable daily intake as established by the World Health Organization. Non-carcinogenic risk modeling indicated probable adverse health effects from chronic exposure to soil Pb. The mean estimated time for remediation of the area using phytoextraction was high, ranging from 76 to 259 years; therefore, this is not a viable alternative for remediating soils in the studied area. However, good development in the contaminated soil along with restriction of the metal(oid) translocation to shoots enables castor bean to phytostabilize metal(oid)s. Additionally, castor bean cultivation may be an alternative for an economic return because of biofuel production.', 'Soil and Uncaria rhynchophylla in different functional areas were selected for the study,the content of heavy metals such as As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, and Hg in soil and U. rhynchophylla was discussed, the characteristics of their accumulation in the U.rhynchophylla was analyzed, the contamination levels of heavy metals in soil in different functional areas was evaluated.

Packaged ice is commercially produced and can be easily found in grocery and convenience stores. However, the quality and safety of packaged ice products is not consistent. The Packaged Ice Quality Control Standards manual (PIQCS) published by the International Packaged Ice Association provides the quality and processing standards for packaged ice produced by its members. Packaged ice produced on the premise of stores (on-site packaged ice) is not required to be in compliance with these standards. In this study, packaged ice produced by manufacturing plants or by in-store bagger (ISB) machines and on-site packaged ice were compared for their microbiological quality and microbial diversity. Our results revealed that 19% of the 120 on-site packaged ice samples did not meet the PIQCS microbial limit of 500 CFU/mL (or g) and also the absence of coliforms and Escherichia coli . Staphylococci were found in 34% of the on-site packaged ice samples, most likely through contamination from the packaging workers. None of the ISB and manufactured packaged ice samples had unacceptable microbial levels, and all were devoid of staphylococci. Salmonella was absent in all samples analyzed in this study. Microbial community analysis of ice based on 16S/18S rRNA targeted sequencing revealed a much higher microbial diversity and abundance in the on-site packaged ice than in the ISB ice. Proteobacteria, especially Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, were the dominant bacterial groups in all samples tested. Most of these bacteria were oligotrophic; however, a few opportunistic or potential pathogens were found at low levels in the on-site packaged ice but not in the ISB packaged ice.

Each step is susceptible to threats of environmental contamination or failure to safeguard the processes. The production process can be controlled in the food and agricultural sector, where smart sensors can play a major role, ensuring greater food quality and safety by low cost, fast, reliable, and profitable methods of detection. Techniques for the detection of pathogens and toxins may vary in cost, size, and specificity, speed of response, sensitivity, and precision. Smart sensors can detect, analyse and quantify at molecular levels contents of different biological origin and ensure quality of foods against spiking with pesticides, fertilizers, dioxin, modified organisms, anti-nutrients, allergens, drugs and so on.

However, the underlying mechanisms of the interactions between Hg and Se in plants, as well as the metabolism of Hg-Se compounds in crops are still far from being understood. The botanic metallomics of Hg and Se mainly focuses on the translocation, transformation, and metabolism of Hg and Se in the environmental and botanic systems employing metallomics methods. An adequate understanding of the biological behavior of Hg and Se in plant is beneficial for sequestration of Hg and Se in soil-plant systems with high Hg and Se contamination. It can also provide a molecular mechanistic basis for Se supplementation in Se-deficient areas. Here, the key developments in current understanding of Hg and Se interactions in plants are reviewed. The metabolism and antagonism of Hg and Se in various plants, as well as the advanced analytical methods commonly used in this field, are summarized and discussed.

The objective of this study was to assess the extent of that risk and to evaluate the effect of intervention measures along the agri-food chain. A stochastic farm-to-fork quantitative microbial risk assessment model was developed following the Codex Alimentarius Guidelines for Risk Analysis of Foodborne Antimicrobial Resistance. Different scenarios were analyzed to assess the individual relative effects of 18 possible interventions in comparison to a baseline scenario. The baseline scenario represented the first year of on-farm antimicrobial use surveillance in the Canadian broiler industry and the year before an industry-imposed ban on the preventive use of antimicrobials of very high importance to human health (2013), where 31.3% of broiler flocks consisted of birds to which ceftiofur was administered. The baseline scenario predicted an average probability of illness of 1.1 per 100,000 servings (SE: 0.064 per 100,000), corresponding to an average of 22,000 human infections (SE: 1900) with ceftiofur-resistant S. Heidelberg per year, which is likely an overestimation. This risk was reduced by 90% or 20% when two separate scenarios designed to capture the effect of withdrawing preventive ceftiofur use from poultry production were simulated using different approaches; data used for the former scenario were confounded by other potential concomitant control measures (e.g. Salmonella vaccination programme), so the true effect likely lies somewhere between the two estimates. A theoretical 'worst case' scenario where all flocks had birds exposed to ceftiofur increased the risk by 107%. A 50% reduction in the probability of human prior exposure to antimicrobials, which has a selective and competitive effect for Salmonella spp. following ingestion of contaminated products, reduced the risk by 65%. Other promising measures that could be considered for further risk management included improved cleaning and disinfection between broiler flocks on farm (risk reduction by 26%), exclusive use of air chilling (risk reduction by 34%), and the improvement of meat storage and preparation conditions, e.g., no temperature abuse at retail (risk reduction by 88%). These findings showed the importance of a structured approach to assessing and potentially implementing effective interventions to reduce the risk associated with ceftiofur-resistant S. Heidelberg at different steps along the agri-food chain. Major data gaps included information on concentrations of resistant bacteria, cross contamination at processing and how ceftiofur-resistant S.

Mycotoxin exposure can lead to mycotoxicosis in both animals and humans when found in animal feeds and food products, and at lower concentrations can affect animal performance by disrupting nutrient digestion, absorption, metabolism, and animal physiology. Thus, mycotoxin contamination of animal feeds represents a significant issue to the livestock industry and is a health threat to food animals. Since prevention of mycotoxin formation is difficult to undertake to avoid contamination, mitigation strategies are needed. This review explores how the mycotoxins aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins and ochratoxin A impose nutritional and metabolic effects on food animals and summarizes mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of mycotoxicity.', 'Mycotoxins are toxic fungal secondary metabolities formed by a variety of fungi (moulds) species.

A large number of food-related products and beverages are yearly contaminated by mycotoxins, resulting in economic welfare losses. Mycotoxin indoor environment contamination is a global problem especially in less technologically developed countries. There is an ongoing effort in prevention of mould growth in the field and decontamination of contaminated food and feed in order to protect human and animal health. It should be emphasized that the mycotoxins production by fungi (moulds) species is unavoidable and that they are more toxic than pesticides. Human and animals are exposed to mycotoxin via food, inhalation, or contact which can result in many building-related illnesses including kidney and neurological diseases and cancer. In this review, we described in detail the molecular aspects of main representatives of mycotoxins, which are serious problems for global health, such as aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, patulin, and zearalenone.', 'Mycotoxin contamination in food poses health hazards to humans.

The natural occurrence of nickel arises from the fact that the element plays an essential role in the functioning of enzymes involved in the nitrogen fixation process. Besides, contamination can occur at any stage of the production, processing or packing of the foods. More specifically, nickel can leach from contact materials to foods or drinks before their consumption by humans. In recent years, the European Food Safety Authority expressed concern regarding the chronic and acute exposure of the European population to nickel. This study aimed to screen foods available on the Belgian market for their nickel content and to identify potential sources of the contamination. In total, 708 samples were collected from three different main categories of foods, including plant-based products, animal-based products and drinks. Elevated nickel concentrations were found in plant-based products such as chocolate, legumes, nuts, figs, peanut butter, chocolate spreads and breakfast cereals. The nickel concentrations in the animal-based products and drinks were significantly lower compared to the plant-based products. In the beer samples, no correlation between the alcohol percentage and nickel concentration was found. Higher nickel concentrations were found in the tea drinks in comparison to other drinks. Furthermore, the effect of packaging, e.g. storage in cans, on the final nickel concentration of the foods was investigated. No effect of the packaging was found, demonstrating that leaching of nickel from packaging materials is not significantly contributing to the nickel content in foods. The results demonstrate high concentrations of nickel in some plant-based food products and further exposure assessment studies are needed to evaluate the risk due to intake of nickel-enriched food products.', 'The metal nickel is well known to cause nickel allergy in sensitive humans by prolonged dermal contact to materials releasing (high) amounts of nickel.

The study was to evaluate and compare the resistance of detached-cells of biofilm formed by S. aureus and planktonic cells to Ultra High Pressure Homogenization (UHPH), a non-thermal technology applied in food processing. The results showed that the survival of both detached-cells and planktonic cells was dependent upon the applied pressure ranging from 30,000 PSI to 40,000 PSI, and cycle numbers with 1 and 3.

By integrating chemicals' multimedia environment exchange, food web, and source tracking systems, the framework was implemented to identify short-chain chlorinated paraffin (SCCP) contamination of fresh hairtail fish sold by a Walmart supermarket in Xi'an, northwestern China, and sourced in Eastern China Sea coastal waters. The framework was shown to successfully predict SCCP level with a mean of 17.8 ng g"", 'Conventional food supply chains are centralized in nature and possess challenges pertaining to a single point of failure, product irregularities, quality compromises, and loss of data. Numerous cases of food fraud, contamination, and adulteration are daily reported from multiple parts of India, suggesting the absolute need for an upgraded decentralized supply chain model. A country such as India, where its biggest strength is its demographic dividend, cannot afford to malnutrition a large population of its children by allowing them to consume contaminated and adulterated dairy products. In view of the gravity of the situation, we propose a blockchain-enabled supply chain platform for the dairy industry. With respect to the supply chain platform, the dairy products of choice include milk, cheese, and butter. Blockchain is one of the fastest growing technologies having widespread acceptance across multiple industry verticals. Blockchain possesses the power to transform traditional supply chains into decentralized, robust, transparent, tamper proof, and sustainable supply chains. The proposed supply chain platform goes beyond the aspect of food traceability and focuses on maintaining the nutritional values of dairy products, identification of adulteration and contamination in dairy products, the increasing economic viability of running a dairy farm, preventing counterfeit dairy products, and enhancing the revenue of the dairy company. The paper collates the mentioned functionalities into four distinct impact dimensions: social, economic, operations, and sustainability. The proposed blockchain-enabled dairy supply chain platform combines the use of smart contracts, quick response code (QR code) technology, and IoT and has the potential to redefine the dairy supply chains on socio-economic, operational, and sustainability parameters.', 'The increasing number of rice product safety issues and the potential for contamination have established an enormous need for an effective strategy for the traceability of the rice supply chain. Tracing the origins of a rice product from raw materials to end customers is very complex and costly. Existing food supply chain methods (for example, rice) do not provide a scalable and cost-effective means of agricultural food supply. Besides, consumers lack the capability and resources required to check or report on the quality of agricultural goods in terms of defects or contamination. Consequently, customers are forced to decide whether to utilize or discard the goods. However, blockchain is an innovative framework capable of offering a transformative solution for the traceability of agricultural products and food supply chains. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework capable of tracking and monitoring all interactions and transactions between all stakeholders in the rice chain ecosystem through smart contracts. The model incorporates a system for customer satisfaction feedback, which enables all stakeholders to get up-to-date information on product quality, enabling them to make more informed supply chain decisions. Each transaction is documented and stored in the public ledger of the blockchain. The proposed framework provides a safe, efficient, reliable, and effective way to monitor and track rice products safety and quality especially during product purchasing. The security and performance analysis results shows that the proposed framework outperform the benchmark techniques in terms of cost-effectiveness, security and scalability with low computational overhead.']"

Cd contamination may cause olfactory dysfunction and consequently disorders in the social behavior of ants. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of Cd exposure on the chemosensory process of ants, we characterized the Cd-induced variations in the expression of genes involved in chemoreception and electrophysiological and behavioral sensitivity to semiochemicals by using the red imported fire ant, ', 'Contamination of agro-ecosystems with heavy metals can affect the development and reproduction of insect natural enemies. This study reports a detailed Tandem Mass Tag based quantitative proteomic analysis of underlying mechanisms responsible for stress response of Cryptolaemus montrouzieri against heavy metals (cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb)) transported across a multi-trophic food chain. A total of 6639 proteins were detected under Cd as well as Pb stress. In Pb versus the control cluster, 69 proteins (28 up-regulated and 41 down-regulated) were differentially expressed whereas 268 proteins were differentially expressed under Cd versus the control cluster, having 198 proteins up-regulated and 70 down-regulated proteins. The analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed that 27 proteins overlapped in both clusters representing the core proteome to Pb and Cd stress. The bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that these proteins were mapped to 57 and 99 pathways in Pb versus control and Cd versus control clusters, respectively. The functional classification by COG, GO and KEGG databases showed significant changes in protein expression by C. montrouzieri under Pb and Cd stress. The heavy metal stress (Pb and Cd) induced significant changes in expression of proteins like hexokinase (HK), succinyl-CoA, trypsin like proteins, cysteine proteases, cell division cycle proteins, and yellow gene proteins. The results provide detailed information on the protein expression levels of C. montrouzieri and will serve as basic information for future proteomic studies on heavy metal responses of insect predators within a multi-trophic food chain.', 'The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative changes in the proteome of the hemolymph of female Steatoda grossa spiders (Theridiidae) that were chronically exposed to cadmium and copper in food and were additionally immunostimulated (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA); bacterial suspensions: Staphylococcus aureus (G+), Pseudomonas fluorescens (G-). It was found that the expression of nearly 90 proteins was altered in cadmium-intoxicated spiders and more than 60 in copper-exposed individuals. Regardless of the type of metal used, these proteins were mainly overexpressed in the hemolymph of the exposed spiders. On the other hand, immunostimulation did not significantly change the number of proteins with altered expression in metal-intoxicated individuals. Hemocyanin (Hc) was found to be the most abundant of the proteins identified with altered expression. In copper-intoxicated spiders, immunostimulation increased the expression of A-, E-, F-, and G-chain-containing proteins, while in the case of cadmium-intoxicates spiders, it decreased the expression of E- and A-chain-containing Hc and increased the expression of G-chain-containing Hc. Regardless of the type of metal and immunostimulant used, there was an increase in the expression of actin. In addition, cadmium increased the expression of cullin, vimentin, and ceruloplasmin. The changes observed in the expression of hemolymph proteins indicate their protective function in S. grossa (Theridiidae) spiders under conditions of metal exposure.']"
