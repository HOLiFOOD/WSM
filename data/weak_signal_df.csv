During foraging, an animal faces many threats, such as predation and infection. The uptake of parasites and diseases while foraging is common and an individual should be adapted to detect and avoid such threats, using cues from either the abiotic environment or the parasite. Social animals possess an additional cue to detect such contaminated food sources: information provided by conspecifics. Bumblebees avoid contaminated flowers, but the cues used by the bees to distinguish contamination remain unknown. Under controlled laboratory conditions, we tested the use of scent marks derived from other foragers in choosing between a contaminated (by Crithidia bombi) and an uncontaminated flower. As a positive control we tested the bee's choice between two flowers, one scented with geraniol and containing a highly rewarding sugar solution, and the other not scented and containing a poorer reward. The bees mainly chose the uncontaminated and the rewarding scented flowers. Scent marks did not increase the efficiency of the bumblebees in choosing the better flower. The bees from both experiments behaved similarly, showing that the main and most relevant cue used to choose the uncontaminated flower is the odour from the parasite itself. The adaptation of bumblebees to avoid flowers contaminated by C. bombi arose from the long-term host-parasite interaction between these species. This strong adaptation results in an innate behaviour of bees and a detection and aversion of the odour of contaminated flower nectar."", 'Animals often alter their food choices following a pathogen infection in order to increase immune function and combat the infection. Whether social animals that collect food for their brood or nestmates adjust their nutrient intake to the infection states of their social partners is virtually unexplored. Here we develop an individual-based model of nutritional geometry to examine the impact of collective nutrient balancing on pathogen spread in a social insect colony. The model simulates a hypothetical social insect colony infected by a horizontally transmitted parasite. Simulation experiments suggest that collective nutrition, by which foragers adjust their nutrient intake to simultaneously address their own nutritional needs as well as those of their infected nestmates, is an efficient social immunity mechanism to limit contamination when immune responses are short. Impaired foraging in infected workers can favour colony resilience when pathogen transmission rate is low (by reducing contacts with the few infected foragers) or trigger colony collapse when transmission rate is fast (by depleting the entire pool of foragers). Our theoretical examination of dietary collective medication in social insects suggests a new possible mechanism by which colonies can defend themselves against pathogens and provides a conceptual framework for experimental investigations of the nutritional immunology of social animals.', 'Animals often alter their food choices following a pathogen infection in order to increase immune function and combat the infection.

Diet is one modifiable risk factor that women may be motivated to improve. General healthy eating guidelines, micronutrient sufficiency and macronutrient quantity and quality are important nutrition considerations pre and during pregnancy. With regards to specific nutrients, health authorities have recommendations for folate and/or iodine supplementation; but not consistently for iron and omega-3 despite evidence for their association with health outcomes. There are modest additional requirements for energy and protein, but not fat or carbohydrate, in mid-late pregnancy. Diet indices and dietary pattern analysis are additional tools or methodologies used to assess diet quality. These tools have been used to determine dietary intakes and patterns and their association with pregnancy complications and birth outcomes pre or during pregnancy. Women who may unnecessarily resist foods due to fear of food contamination from listeriosis and methylmercury may limit their diet quality and a balanced approached is required. Dietary intake may also vary according to certain population characteristics. Additional support for women who are younger, less educated, overweight and obese, from socially disadvantaged areas, smokers and those who unnecessarily avoid healthy foods, is required to achieve a higher quality diet and optimal lifestyle peri conception.', 'The etiology of hypospadias is poorly understood. Exposure to pesticides has been considered a risk factor, although findings are inconsistent. Diet constitutes a significant exposure route for pesticides, and pesticide residues are more frequently reported in conventional than organic food products. We examined the association between organic dietary choice during pregnancy and presence of hypospadias in the offspring.\nMothers of 306 boys operated on for hypospadias were frequency matched for geography and child birth year to 306 mothers of healthy boys in a case-control study. Telephone interviews were conducted regarding demographic and lifestyle factors, including intake and organic choice of selected food items (milk, dairy products, egg, fruit, vegetables and meat). Logistic regression models were constructed for dietary variables, and odds ratios were calculated controlling for maternal age, body mass index and alcohol consumption.\nOverall organic choice of food items during pregnancy was not associated with hypospadias in the offspring. However, frequent current consumption of high fat dairy products (milk, butter) while rarely or never choosing the organic alternative to these products during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of hypospadias (adjusted OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.09-4.36).\nThis large case-control study of boys operated on for hypospadias suggests an association between hypospadias in the offspring and the mother not choosing the organic alternative, and having a high current intake of nonorganic butter and cheese. This finding could be due to chemical contamination of high fat dairy products. However, general lifestyle and health behavior related to choosing organic alternatives may also explain the finding.', 'The aim of this study was to describe the dietary patterns of pregnant women in northern Puerto Rico and explore associations between diet factors with pregnancy related measurements. This analysis is based on the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT), a prospective cohort that is studying environmental risk factors for preterm births in PR. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) around 20-28 weeks of gestation. The following pregnancy related measures were collected from the medical records: hemoglobin, blood glucose, blood pressure and gestational age. Potential associations between diet factors and pregnancy measures were assessed using chi square analysis with SPSS. A total of 180 participants completed the FFQ; low hemoglobin levels was found in 19.2%, high blood glucose levels was found in 21.1% by fasting blood glucose test and 24.6%by 1-hour 50 g oral glucose screening test, high blood pressure was found in 2.9% (systolic) and 6.5% (diastolic), and pre-term birth was found in 10.4% of the participants. High consumption of rice, desserts and sweets was associated with higher levels of fasting blood glucose levels (p < 0.05), while high consumption of vegetables was associated with higher 1-hour glucose challenge test (p < 0.05).No other significant associations were found. In conclusion, consumption of high dense energy food diets in pregnancy, such as rice, sweets and desserts, can lead to high levels of blood glucose and can be a potential predictor of other pregnancy complications during pregnancy in these study participants, such as gestational diabetes.']"

The rapidity and efficacy of the approach have suggested applications in counter-bioterrorism, prevention of food contamination, and monitoring the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Strain-level resolution has been reported with diverse bacteria, using library-based and bioinformatics-enabled approaches. Three types of characterization at the strain level have been reported: strain categorization, strain differentiation, and strain identification. Efforts to enhance the library-based approach have involved sample pre-treatment and data reduction strategies. Bioinformatics approaches have leveraged the ever-increasing amount of publicly available genomic and proteomic data to attain strain-level characterization. Bioinformatics-enabled strategies have facilitated strain characterization via intact biomarker identification, bottom-up, and top-down approaches. Rigorous quantitative and advanced statistical analyses have fostered success at the strain level with both approaches. Library-based approaches can be limited by effects of sample preparation and culture conditions on reproducibility, whereas bioinformatics-enabled approaches are typically limited to bacteria, for which genetic and/or proteomic data are available. Biological molecules other than proteins produced in strain-specific manners, including lipids and lipopeptides, might represent other avenues by which strain-level resolution might be attained. Immunological and lectin-based chemistries have shown promise to enhance sensitivity and specificity. Whereas the limits of the taxonomic resolution of MALDI TOF MS profiling of bacteria appears bacterium-specific, recent data suggest that these limits might not yet have been reached.', 'Identification of unwanted microbial contaminants microscopically observed in food products is challenging due to their low abundance in a complex matrix, quite often containing other microorganisms.

The variations of Pb concentration in different parts of rootstalk vegetables (radish, carrot and potato) were investigated by using twelve cultivars grown in acidic Ferralsols and neutral Cambisols under two Pb treatments (125 mg kg(-1) and 250 mg kg(-1) for Ferralsols; 150 mg kg(-1) and 300 mg kg(-1) for Cambisols) in a pot experiment. The Pb concentration in edible parts was higher in Ferralsols under two Pb treatments, with range from 0.28 to 4.14, 0.42-10.66 mg kg(-1) (fresh weight) respectively, and all of them exceeded the food safety standard (0.1 mg kg(-1)) recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO and WHO. The Pb concentration in edible parts was significantly affected by genotype, soil type and the interaction between these two factors. The variation of Pb concentration in different cultivars was partially governed by Pb absorption and the transfer of Pb from aerial to edible part. The results revealed that caution should be paid to the cultivation of rootstalk vegetables in Pb-contaminated Ferralsols without any agronomic management to reduce Pb availability and plant uptake. For Cambisols with slight to moderate Pb contamination, growing potato cultivar Shandong No.1 and Chongqing No.1 was effective in reducing the risk of Pb entering human food chain. The results suggest the possibility of developing cultivar- and soil-specific planting and monitoring guidelines for the cultivation of rootstalk vegetables on slight to moderate Pb-contaminated soils.', 'Phosphogypsum (PG) is a waste produced by the phosphate fertilizer industry that has relatively high concentrations of some heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, V, and Zn). The present study was conducted to investigate heavy metal contamination in soils and vegetables (tomatoes and green peppers) and to evaluate the possible health risks associated with the consumption of vegetables grown in PG-amended soils. The enrichment factor values indicated that Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and V were depleted to minimally enriched, and Cd was moderately enriched. The pollution load index values indicated that the PG-amended soils were strongly polluted with Cd, moderately polluted with Cr and Ni, and slightly polluted with Pb, Cu, Zn and V. The geo-accumulation index values indicated that the PG-amended soils were uncontaminated with Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, V, and moderately contaminated with Cd.

Historically, the exposure of aflatoxin in Malaysia can be dated in 1960s where an outbreak of disease in pig farms caused severe liver damage to the animals. Later, an aflatoxicosis case in Perak in 1988 was reported and caused death to 13 children, as up to 3 mg of aflatoxin was present in a single serving of contaminated noodles. Since then, extensive research on aflatoxin has been conducted in Malaysia. The food commodities such as peanuts, cereals, spices, and their products are the main commodities commonly found to be contaminated with aflatoxin. Surprisingly, some of the contaminated foods had levels greater than the permissible limit adopted by the Malaysian Food Regulation 1985. Besides, exposure assessment through the measurement of aflatoxin biomarkers in human biological samples is still in its infancy stage. Nevertheless, some studies had reported the presence of these biomarkers. In fact, it is postulated that Malaysians are moderately exposed to aflatoxin compared to those high risk populations, where aflatoxin contamination in the diets is prevalent. Since the ingestion of aflatoxin could be the integral to the development of liver cancer, the incidence of cancer attributable by dietary aflatoxin exposure in Malaysia has also been reported and published in the literatures. Regardless of these findings, the more important task is to monitor and control humans from being exposed to aflatoxin. The enforcement of law is insufficient to minimize human exposure to aflatoxin. Preventive strategies include agricultural, dietary, and clinical measures should be implemented. With the current research on aflatoxin in Malaysia, a global networking for research collaboration is needed to expand the knowledge and disseminate the information to the global scientific community.', 'A high performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for determination of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in foods using a monolithic column with sample clean up on an immunoaffinity column. The method was validated for analysis of AFB1 in rice, bread, puffed corn snack, wheat flour and peanut samples. The average recoveries for AFB1 in different foods ranged from 94.4 to 102.5% with the coefficient of variation lower than 10% for all foods. Limit of detection was 0.01 ng/g. A survey of AFB1 was performed on 90 samples collected from Tehran retail market in June 2005. The results showed that none of the bread and wheat flour samples were contaminated with AFB1. The mean AFB1 levels in rice, puffed corn snack and peanut samples were 4.17, 0.11, and 1.97 ng/g, respectively. The level of contamination of 3 samples (one rice sample and two peanuts samples) to AFB1 was found to be higher than 5 ng/g. Although all food samples had mean concentration of AFB1 below the maximum tolerated level in Iran, the mean intake of AFB1 from rice was estimated 3.49 times higher than the guidance value of 1 ng AFB1/Kg body weight/day. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to monitor AFB1 in foods, especially in rice, in Iran. This is the first study on exposure assessment of Iranian population to AFB1.', 'Aflatoxin B1 (AfB1) is a secondary fungal metabolite product widely found in many foodstuffs and considered a public health concern worldwide due to its genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Tropical climate and inappropriate food safety practices in Indonesia are the favorable conditions for AfB1 contamination of foodstuffs. Despite these challenges, there has been a limited number of risk assessment of AfB1 conducted in Indonesia. Therefore, this paper aimed to gather all available occurrence data of AfB1 in maize and peanut originating from Indonesia and used the occurrence data to evaluate the risk of exposure to AfB1 using the Margin of Exposure (MOE) and the quantitative liver cancer risk approaches established by EFSA and FAO/WHO respectively. Risk assessment using both the MOE and quantitative liver cancer risk approaches revealed that AfB1 exposure from maize and peanut consumption in Indonesia is of concern. The MOE values derived from consumption of maize and peanut originating from Indonesia were generally below 10,000, and for several occurrence data were even below 1000. The estimated number of liver cancer cases associated with AfB1 exposure generally was above the 0.1 cancer cases/100,000 individuals/75 years. Altogether the evaluation reveals the urgency for risk management of AfB1 in Indonesia.']"

In order to identify soil properties with statistically significant influence on cadmium concentration in vegetables and to reduce the collection of data, time and costs, regression models can be applied. The main objective of this research was to develop regression models to predict the concentration of cadmium in 9-vegetable species: zucchini, tomato, cabbage, onion, potato, carrot, red beet, endive and chicory, based on soil properties. Soil samples were collected from 123 home gardens of the Municipality of Celje and 59 of these gardens were also included in vegetable sampling. The concentration of elements (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) in the samples was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Single (for cabbage, potato, red beet and chicory) and multiple (for tomato, onion, carrot and endive) linear regression models were developed. There was no statistically significant regression model for zucchini. The most significant parameter for the influencing the cadmium concentration in vegetables was the concentration of cadmium in soil. Other important soil properties were the content of organic matter, pH-value and the concentration of manganese. It was concluded that consuming carrots, red beets, endives, onions, potatoes and chicory which are grown in gardens with Cd concentrations (mgkg(-1) DW) above 2.4, 3.2, 6.3, 7.9, 8.3 and 10.9, respectively, might represent an important contribution to dietary Cd exposure.', ""Toxicity and accumulation of cadmium in body organs by eating contaminated food has an important role in endangering a human's health.

Due to the inherent microbial vulnerability of aseptic-UHT product formulations, the safety and stability-related performance objectives (POs) required at the end of the manufacturing process are the most demanding found in the food industry. The key determinants to achieving sterility, and which also differentiates aseptic-UHT from in-pack sterilised products, are the challenges associated with the processes of aseptic filling and sealing. This is a complex process that has traditionally been run using deterministic or empirical process settings. Quantifying the risk of microbial contamination and recontamination along the aseptic-UHT process, using the scientifically based process quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), offers the possibility to improve on the currently tolerable sterility failure rate (i.e., 1 defect per 10,000 units). In addition, benefits of applying QMRA are (i) to implement process settings in a transparent and scientific manner; (ii) to develop a uniform common structure whatever the production line, leading to a harmonisation of these process settings, and; (iii) to bring elements of a cost-benefit analysis of the management measures. The objective of this article is to explore how QMRA techniques and risk management metrics may be applied to aseptic-UHT-type processed food products. In particular, the aseptic-UHT process should benefit from a number of novel mathematical and statistical concepts that have been developed in the field of QMRA. Probabilistic techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian inference and sensitivity analysis, should help in assessing the compliance with safety and stability-related POs set at the end of the manufacturing process. The understanding of aseptic-UHT process contamination will be extended beyond the current ""as-low-as-reasonably-achievable"" targets to a risk-based framework, through which current sterility performance and future process designs can be optimised.', 'Aseptic-Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT) products are manufactured to be free of microorganisms capable of growing in the food at normal non-refrigerated conditions at which the food is likely to be held during manufacture, distribution and storage. Two important phases within the process are widely recognised as critical in controlling microbial contamination: the sterilisation steps and the following aseptic steps. Of the microbial hazards, the pathogen spore formers Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus cereus are deemed the most pertinent to be controlled. In addition, due to a relatively high thermal resistance, Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores are considered a concern for spoilage of low acid aseptic-UHT products. A probabilistic exposure assessment model has been developed in order to assess the aseptic-UHT product failure rate associated with these three bacteria. It was a Modular Process Risk Model, based on nine modules. They described: i) the microbial contamination introduced by the raw materials, either from the product (i.e. milk, cocoa and dextrose powders and water) or the packaging (i.e. bottle and sealing component), ii) the sterilisation processes, of either the product or the packaging material, iii) the possible recontamination during subsequent processing of both product and packaging. The Sterility Failure Rate (SFR) was defined as the sum of bottles contaminated for each batch, divided by the total number of bottles produced per process line run (10(6) batches simulated per process line). The SFR associated with the three bacteria was estimated at the last step of the process (i.e. after Module 9) but also after each module, allowing for the identification of modules, and responsible contamination pathways, with higher or lower intermediate SFR. The model contained 42 controlled settings associated with factory environment, process line or product formulation, and more than 55 probabilistic inputs corresponding to inputs with variability conditional to a mean uncertainty. It was developed in @Risk and run through Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the highest SFR was associated with G. stearothermophilus (380000 bottles contaminated in 10(11) bottles produced) and the lowest to C. botulinum (3 bottles contaminated in 10(11) bottles produced). Unsurprisingly, SFR due to G. stearothermophilus was due to its ability to survive the UHT treatment. More interestingly, it was identified that SFR due to B. cereus (17000 bottles contaminated in 10(11) bottles produced) was due to an airborne recontamination of the aseptic tank (49%) and a post-sterilisation packaging contamination (33%). A deeper analysis (sensitivity and scenario analyses) was done to investigate how the SFR due to B. cereus could be reduced by changing the process settings related to potential air recontamination source.', 'Aseptic-Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT) products are manufactured to be free of microorganisms capable of growing in the food at normal non-refrigerated conditions at which the food is likely to be held during manufacture, distribution and storage.

The survival of food pathogens in the GIT is known to depend on food carrier properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of food buffering capacity and food structure on the survival of Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes during simulated digestion, following contamination of different food model systems that had different combinations of fat and protein content. The results illustrated the strong protective properties of proteins, acting either as a strong buffering agent or as a physical barrier against gastric acidity, for both pathogens. In comparison, fat manifested a lower buffering capacity and weaker protective effects against the two pathogens. Intriguingly, a low fat content was often linked with increased microbial resistance. Nonetheless, both pathogens survived their transit through the simulated GIT in all cases, with S. Typhimurium exhibiting growth during intestinal digestion and L.monocytogenes demonstrating a healthy residual population at the end of the intestinal phase. These results corroborate the need for a deeper understanding regarding the mechanisms with which food affects bacterial survival in the human GIT.', 'According to Codex Alimentarius Commission recommendations, management options applied at the process production level should be based on good hygiene practices, HACCP system, and new risk management metrics such as the food safety objective.

Through a specific case study, Listeria monocytogenes in soft cheese made from pasteurized milk, the objective of the present article is to practically show how quantitative risk assessment could be used to direct potential intervention strategies at different food processing steps.

Antibiotics added to the sample cultures are apparently effective if the emission of hydrogen is suppressed, or if not, are either ineffective or the related bacteria are even resistant. The sensor approach was applied to prove bacterial contamination in food, animals, medical specimens and in ticks infected by ', 'Hygiene hypothesis and sanitization are two important pivots of modern civilization. The drinking water should be free from urine and stool contamination. Coliform test is popular for understanding feces contamination. However, understanding urine contamination in drinking water is a difficult task. On the other hand, urine contamination can cause disease like leptospirosis. It occurs mainly in animals and infects humans through contaminated water, food, and soil and causes serious consequences. Rat urine is the most common source of such disease outbreaks. Further, sophisticated laboratories with high-end technologies may not be present at the site of disease outbreaks. In this context, we have proposed a spectrofluorimetric approach to screen urine contamination in water. The screening method can sense up to 156 nl/ml of rat urine.', 'Healthcare-associated infections (HCAI/HAI) represent a substantial threat to patient health during hospitalization and incur billions of dollars additional cost for subsequent treatment. One promising method for the detection of bacterial contamination in a clinical setting before an HAI outbreak occurs is to exploit native fluorescence of cellular molecules for a hand-held, rapid-sweep surveillance instrument. Previous studies have shown fluorescence-based detection to be sensitive and effective for food-borne and environmental microorganisms, and even to be able to distinguish between cell types, but this powerful technique has not yet been deployed on the macroscale for the primary surveillance of contamination in healthcare facilities to prevent HAI. Here we report experimental data for the specification and design of such a fluorescence-based detection instrument. We have characterized the complete fluorescence response of eleven clinically-relevant bacteria by generating excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) over broad wavelength ranges. Furthermore, a number of surfaces and items of equipment commonly present on a ward, and potentially responsible for pathogen transfer, have been analyzed for potential issues of background fluorescence masking the signal from contaminant bacteria. These include bedside handrails, nurse call button, blood pressure cuff and ward computer keyboard, as well as disinfectant cleaning products and microfiber cloth. All examined bacterial strains exhibited a distinctive double-peak fluorescence feature associated with tryptophan with no other cellular fluorophore detected. Thus, this fluorescence survey found that an emission peak of 340nm, from an excitation source at 280nm, was the cellular fluorescence signal to target for detection of bacterial contamination. The majority of materials analysed offer a spectral window through which bacterial contamination could indeed be detected. A few instances were found of potential problems of background fluorescence masking that of bacteria, but in the case of the microfiber cleaning cloth, imaging techniques could morphologically distinguish between stray strands and bacterial contamination.']"

Compounding these problems, insect pests often vector pathogenic or toxigenic microbes to plants. Previous work has considered plant-insect and plant-microbe interactions separately. Although insects are well-understood to use plant volatiles to locate hosts, microorganisms can produce distinct and abundant volatile compounds that in some cases strongly attract insects. In this paper, we focus on the microbial contribution to plant volatile blends, highlighting the compounds emitted and the potential for variation in microbial emission. We suggest that these aspects of microbial volatile emission may make these compounds ideal for use in agricultural applications, as they may be more specific or enhance methods currently used in insect control or monitoring. Our survey of microbial volatiles in insect-plant interactions suggests that these emissions not only signal host suitability but may indicate a distinctive time frame for optimal conditions for both insect and microbe. Exploitation of these host-specific microbe semiochemicals may provide important microbe- and host-based attractants and a basis for future plant-insect-microbe chemical ecology investigations.', 'More than half of the proteome from mandibular glands in caterpillars is represented by chemosensory proteins. Based on sequence similarity, these proteins are putative transporters of ligands to gustatory receptors in sensory organs of insects. We sought to determine whether these proteins are inducible by comparing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the salivary (mandibular and labial) proteomes from caterpillars (Vanessa cardui) reared on different plants and artificial diet containing either bacteria or bacterial cell-walls. We included a treatment where the caterpillars were switched from feeding on artificial diet to plant material at some point in their development. Additionally, we evaluated the degree of overlap between the proteomes in the hemolymph-filled coelom and salivary glands of caterpillars reared on plant material. We found that the quality and quantity of the identified proteins differed clearly between hemolymph-filled coelome, labial and mandibular glands. Our results indicated that even after molting and two-day feeding on a new diet, protein production is affected by the previous food source used by the caterpillar. Candidate proteins involved in chemosensory perception by insects were detected: three chemosensory (CSPs) and two odorant-binding proteins (OBPs). Using the relative amounts of these proteins across tissues and treatments as criteria for their classification, we detected hemolymph- and mandibular gland-specific CSPs and observed that their levels were affected by caterpillar diet. Moreover, we could compare the protein and transcript levels across tissues and treatment for at least one CSP and one OBP. Therefore, we have identified specific isoforms for testing the role of CSPs and OBPs in plant and pathogen recognition. We detected catalase, immune-related protein and serine proteases and their inhibitors in high relative levels in the mandibular glands in comparison to the labial glands. These findings suggest that the mandibular glands of caterpillars may play an important role protecting the caterpillar from oxidative stress, pathogens and aiding in digestion. Contamination with hemolymph proteins during dissection of salivary glands from caterpillars may occur but it is not substantial since the proteomes from hemolymph, mandibular and labial glands were easily discriminated from each other by principal component analysis of proteomic data.', 'House flies are of major concern as vectors of food-borne pathogens to food crops. House flies are common pests on cattle feedlots and dairies, where they develop in and feed on animal waste. By contacting animal waste, house flies can acquire human pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., in addition to other bacteria, viruses, or parasites that may infect humans and animals. The subsequent dispersal of house flies from animal facilities to nearby agricultural fields containing food crops may lead to pre-harvest food contamination with these pathogens. We hypothesized that odors from honeydew, the sugary excreta produced by sucking insects feeding on crops, or molds and fungi growing on honeydew, may attract house flies, thereby increasing the risk of food crop contamination. House fly attraction to honeydew-contaminated plant material was evaluated using a laboratory bioassay. House flies were attracted to the following plant-pest-honeydew combinations: citrus mealybug on squash fruit, pea aphid on faba bean plants, whitefly on navel orange and grapefruit leaves, and combined citrus mealybug and cottony cushion scale on mandarin orange leaves. House flies were not attracted to field-collected samples of lerp psyllids on eucalyptus plants or aphids on crepe myrtle leaves. Fungi associated with field-collected honeydews were isolated and identified for further study as possible emitters of volatiles attractive to house flies. Two fungal species, Aureobasidium pullulans and Cladosporium cladosporioides, were repeatedly isolated from field-collected honeydew samples. Both fungal species were grown in potato dextrose enrichment broth and house fly attraction to volatiles from these fungal cultures was evaluated. House flies were attracted to odors from A. pullulans cultures but not to those of C. cladosporioides. Identification of specific honeydew odors that are attractive to house flies could be valuable for the development of improved house fly baits for management of this pest species.']"

The natural occurrence of nickel arises from the fact that the element plays an essential role in the functioning of enzymes involved in the nitrogen fixation process. Besides, contamination can occur at any stage of the production, processing or packing of the foods. More specifically, nickel can leach from contact materials to foods or drinks before their consumption by humans. In recent years, the European Food Safety Authority expressed concern regarding the chronic and acute exposure of the European population to nickel. This study aimed to screen foods available on the Belgian market for their nickel content and to identify potential sources of the contamination. In total, 708 samples were collected from three different main categories of foods, including plant-based products, animal-based products and drinks.

Furthermore, the effect of packaging, e.g. storage in cans, on the final nickel concentration of the foods was investigated. No effect of the packaging was found, demonstrating that leaching of nickel from packaging materials is not significantly contributing to the nickel content in foods.

This gap analysis is an evaluation of nickel as a potential food safety hazard causing a risk for human health. In the first step, the available data regarding the occurrence of nickel and its contamination in food and drinks have been collected through literature review. Subsequently, a discussion is held on the potential risks associated with this contamination. Elevated nickel concentrations were mostly found in plant-based foods, e.g. legumes and nuts in which nickel of natural origin is expected. However, it was observed that dedicated and systematic screening of foodstuffs for the presence of nickel is currently still lacking. In a next step, published studies on exposure of humans to nickel via foods and drinks were critically evaluated. Not including bioaccessibility and/or bioavailability of the metal may lead to an overestimation of the exposure of the body to nickel via food and drinks. This overestimation may be problematic when the measured nickel level in foods is high and bioaccessibility and/or bioavailability of nickel in these products is low. Therefore, this paper analyzes the outcomes of the existing dietary intake and bioaccessibility/bioavailability studies conducted for nickel. Besides, the available gaps in nickel bioaccessibility and/or bioavailability studies have been clarified in this paper. The reported bioaccessibility and bioavailability percentages for different food and drinks were found to vary between <LOD and 83% and between 0 and 30% respectively. This indicates that of the total nickel contained in the foodstuffs only a fraction can be absorbed by the intestinal epithelium cells.

This is frequently associated with an increased use of agrochemicals, leading to environmental contamination and altering microbial communities, including human fungal pathogens that reside in the environment. Cryptococcus gattii is an environmental yeast and is one of the etiological agents of cryptococcosis. Benomyl (BEN) is a broad-spectrum fungicide used on several crops. To study the effects of agrochemicals on fungal pathogens, we first evaluated the susceptibility of C. gattii to BEN and the interactions with clinical antifungals. Antagonistic interaction between BEN and fluconazole was seen and was strain- and concentration-dependent. We then induced BEN-resistance by culturing strains in increasing drug concentrations. One strain demonstrated to be more resistant and showed increased multidrug efflux pump gene (MDR1) expression and increased rhodamine 6G efflux, leading to cross-resistance between BEN and fluconazole. Morphologically, BEN-adapted cells had a reduced polysaccharide capsule; an increased surface/volume ratio; increased growth rate in vitro and inside macrophages and also higher ability in crossing an in vitro model of blood-brain-barrier. BEN-adapted strain demonstrated to be hypervirulent in mice, leading to severe symptoms of cryptococcosis, early mortality and higher fungal burden in the organs, particularly the brain. The parental strain was avirulent in murine model. In vivo cross-resistance between BEN and fluconazole was observed, with mice infected with the adapted strain unable to present any improvement in survival and behavior when treated with this antifungal. Furthermore, BEN-adapted cells cultured in drug-free media maintained the hypervirulent and cross-resistant phenotype, suggesting a persistent effect of BEN on C. gattii. In conclusion, exposure to BEN induces cross-resistance with fluconazole and increases the virulence of C. gattii. Altogether, our results indicate that agrochemicals may lead to unintended consequences on non-target species and this could result in severe healthy problems worldwide.', 'Consortia of Streptomyces spp. (colonies 169, 194, 165 and 130) used in this study are an efficient producer of secondary metabolites like chitinases and antifungal compounds, which may help in the protection of surplus food from spoilage. Qualitative screening for chitinase production and taxonomy of these colonies were undertaken in our previous studies. In the current study, GC-MS analysis of extract produced from the consortia of Streptomyces strains was done for the identification of antifungal compounds. Treatment of surplus food with activated consortia of Streptomyces spp. has protected powdered food for a month, whereas fresh food (unpowdered) was preserved for two days. A control sample of surplus food (untreated) was kept to check the contamination, which resulted in the growth of three fungi (FP-1, FG-1, and FB-1).

The objective of this study was to assess the extent of that risk and to evaluate the effect of intervention measures along the agri-food chain. A stochastic farm-to-fork quantitative microbial risk assessment model was developed following the Codex Alimentarius Guidelines for Risk Analysis of Foodborne Antimicrobial Resistance. Different scenarios were analyzed to assess the individual relative effects of 18 possible interventions in comparison to a baseline scenario. The baseline scenario represented the first year of on-farm antimicrobial use surveillance in the Canadian broiler industry and the year before an industry-imposed ban on the preventive use of antimicrobials of very high importance to human health (2013), where 31.3% of broiler flocks consisted of birds to which ceftiofur was administered. The baseline scenario predicted an average probability of illness of 1.1 per 100,000 servings (SE: 0.064 per 100,000), corresponding to an average of 22,000 human infections (SE: 1900) with ceftiofur-resistant S. Heidelberg per year, which is likely an overestimation. This risk was reduced by 90% or 20% when two separate scenarios designed to capture the effect of withdrawing preventive ceftiofur use from poultry production were simulated using different approaches; data used for the former scenario were confounded by other potential concomitant control measures (e.g. Salmonella vaccination programme), so the true effect likely lies somewhere between the two estimates. A theoretical 'worst case' scenario where all flocks had birds exposed to ceftiofur increased the risk by 107%. A 50% reduction in the probability of human prior exposure to antimicrobials, which has a selective and competitive effect for Salmonella spp. following ingestion of contaminated products, reduced the risk by 65%. Other promising measures that could be considered for further risk management included improved cleaning and disinfection between broiler flocks on farm (risk reduction by 26%), exclusive use of air chilling (risk reduction by 34%), and the improvement of meat storage and preparation conditions, e.g., no temperature abuse at retail (risk reduction by 88%). These findings showed the importance of a structured approach to assessing and potentially implementing effective interventions to reduce the risk associated with ceftiofur-resistant S. Heidelberg at different steps along the agri-food chain. Major data gaps included information on concentrations of resistant bacteria, cross contamination at processing and how ceftiofur-resistant S. Heidelberg behave in comparison with susceptible ones, e.g., in terms of growth and survival ability, as well as pathogenicity and virulence."", ""Despite initiatives to improve the safety of poultry products in the United States, progress has stalled, and salmonellosis incidence is still above Healthy People 2020's goal.

Concentration-based MC have been used by the food industry; however, the public health impact of such approaches is only starting to be assessed. This study evaluated the public health impact of a concentration-based MC for Salmonella in raw ground turkey consumed in the United States using a quantitative risk assessment modeling approach. The distribution of Salmonella concentration in ground turkey was derived from USDA-FSIS monitoring surveys. Other variables and parameters were derived from public databases, literature, and expert opinion. Based on considered concentrations, implementing a MC of 1 cell/g led to an estimated 46.1% reduction (preventable fraction, PF) in the mean probability of illness when consumer cooking and cross-contamination were included. The PF was consistent across scenarios including or excluding cross-contamination and cooking, with slightly lower mean PF when cross-contamination was included. The proportion of lots not compliant with the 1 cell/g MC was 1.05% in the main scenarios and increased nonlinearly when higher Salmonella concentrations were assumed. Assumptions on concentration variability across lots and within lots had a large impact, highlighting the benefit of reducing this uncertainty.

This led to the recall of valsartan in the United States in 2018, and afterward, the recall of other ARBs as well as unrelated medications (e.g., ranitidine). The presence of nitrosamine in ARBs was likely a result of changes in the manufacturing process, although nitrosamine contamination is believed to occur by different mechanisms with other medications. The United States Food and Drug Administration has since taken steps to identify products affected by nitrosamine contamination and mitigate this concern going forward. Despite the contamination of some drug products, studies estimate that the overall risk to patients is low enough to not necessitate changes in prescribing patterns at this time.', 'Ranitidine is a medication that has been used to alleviate heartburn and other disorders for over 40 years.

In addition, the stability issue for this medicine is discussed. After that, we review and discuss the results of the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration laboratory testing of ranitidine products and the detected NDMA levels.

NDMA exposure to humans is potentially vast, with reports of it occurring in tobacco products, food, water, interior air of cars, toiletries, and a variety of other household goods. Public attention has recently focused on NDMA contamination because it has been implicated in the recall of several medications, including valsartan, losartan, irbesartan, and, most recently, the removal of ranitidine from the market. Its potential for elevated risk of cancer has sparked concern in the health care community. Pharmacists are uniquely situated to process and use this complex information because of their extensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic knowledge of medications, direct and regular contact with patients, insights and familiarity with recalls, and ability to discuss alternative medications that may alleviate a patient's concerns. It is important to communicate the context and clinical relevance of NDMA contamination to both patients and fellow health care clinicians. Pharmacists can help balance the potential adverse effects of switching medication and the concern related to NDMA in making an informed health decision.""]"

Cells that can detach from mature biofilms are a source for microbial cross-contamination in liquid food systems. The study was to evaluate and compare the resistance of detached-cells of biofilm formed by S. aureus and planktonic cells to Ultra High Pressure Homogenization (UHPH), a non-thermal technology applied in food processing. The results showed that the survival of both detached-cells and planktonic cells was dependent upon the applied pressure ranging from 30,000 PSI to 40,000 PSI, and cycle numbers with 1 and 3. A significant difference in UHPH resistance was observed at pressures of 35,000 PSI to 40,000 PSI whereby planktonic cell numbers were reduced about 2.0 log CFU/mL compared to a 0.5 log CFU/mL reduction of detached-cells. Cell resistance was further evaluated following UHPH by measuring membrane integrity and potential, as well as observing the cells using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images revealed more scattered exopolysaccharides in the biofilm after UHPH treatment compared to the control. Additionally, UHPH treatment resulted in planktonic cells having a greater shift to smaller cell size and a wider cell size distribution compared with detached-cells; this indicated a higher resistance of detached-cells to UHPH. This finding suggests that although UHPH has great potential application in food sterilization, the resistance of detached-cells cannot be ignored.', 'The study was to investigate the inhibitory effect and mechanism of high voltage prick electrostatic field (HVPEF) on Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.

It was found that the expression of nearly 90 proteins was altered in cadmium-intoxicated spiders and more than 60 in copper-exposed individuals. Regardless of the type of metal used, these proteins were mainly overexpressed in the hemolymph of the exposed spiders. On the other hand, immunostimulation did not significantly change the number of proteins with altered expression in metal-intoxicated individuals. Hemocyanin (Hc) was found to be the most abundant of the proteins identified with altered expression. In copper-intoxicated spiders, immunostimulation increased the expression of A-, E-, F-, and G-chain-containing proteins, while in the case of cadmium-intoxicates spiders, it decreased the expression of E- and A-chain-containing Hc and increased the expression of G-chain-containing Hc. Regardless of the type of metal and immunostimulant used, there was an increase in the expression of actin. In addition, cadmium increased the expression of cullin, vimentin, and ceruloplasmin. The changes observed in the expression of hemolymph proteins indicate their protective function in S. grossa (Theridiidae) spiders under conditions of metal exposure.']"
