However, poultry also threatens human hygiene, especially as a fomite of infectious diseases caused by the major foodborne pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Listeria). Preventing pathogenic bacterial biofilm is crucial in the chicken industry due to increasing food safety hazards caused by recurring contamination and the rapid degradation of meat, as well as the increased resistance of bacteria to cleaning and disinfection procedures commonly used in chicken processing plants. To address this, various innovative and promising strategies to combat bacterial resistance and biofilm are emerging to improve food safety and quality and extend shelf-life. In particular, natural compounds are attractive because of their potential antimicrobial activities. Natural compounds can also boost the immune system and improve poultry health and performance. In addition to phytochemicals, bacteriophages, nanoparticles, coatings, enzymes, and probiotics represent unique and environmentally friendly strategies in the poultry processing industry to prevent foodborne pathogens from reaching the consumer. Lactoferrin, bacteriocin, antimicrobial peptides, cell-free supernatants, and biosurfactants are also of considerable interest for their prospective application as natural antimicrobials for improving the safety of raw poultry meat. This review aims to describe the feasibility of these proposed strategies and provide an overview of recent published evidences to control microorganisms in the poultry industry, considering the human health, food safety, and economic aspects of poultry production., Food borne diseases are one of the major human disease conditions worldwide. Most of them are of bacterial origin and chickens are a major source of such bacteria; they are consumed at high rate worldwide and tend to harbor the zoonotic bacteria without showing signs of illness. Running rain water tends to increase environmental contamination, since it carries various substances from one area to another; this results in village-indigenous chickens picking more bacteria from the environment as they roam/scavenge around for food. Thus, after the rain, the chickens' intestinal contents may contain more bacteria quantity-wise and type-wise. This study was carried-out to determine whether that was the case after heavy rains of 2018.120 intestine samples were collected from indigenous chickens from three slaughterhouses in Nairobi for bacterial quantification using the Miles and Misra technique; bacterial isolation and identification were carried out using standard bacteriological procedures. Intestines from the slaughterhouses had different mean bacterial counts: Kangemi had the highest (1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; colony-forming units per ml), followed by Burma (5.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;), then Kariokor (4.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most isolated at 85.8%, followed by genera &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; (55%), &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (43.3%), &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; (41.66%), &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; (38.3%), &lt;i&gt;Proteus&lt;/i&gt; (24.16%), &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella&lt;/i&gt; (7.5%), &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; (2.5%), &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; (6%), and &lt;i&gt;Streptobacillus&lt;/i&gt; (0.83%). The study showed that the indigenous chickens carry a variety of bacteria in types and numbers, some of them being zoonotic. Apart from picking more bacteria as a result of environmental contamination during rainy season, the weather and bird-handling further stress the birds, thus contributing to higher bacterial multiplication and higher bacterial carriage. If slaughter is not done right, these intestinal bacteria can easily cause contamination of respective chicken meat; thus, if pathogenic, it can cause food poisoning to consumers of the meat. Therefore, it is recommended that precaution be taken while slaughtering chickens for consumption. In addition, where possible, free-range indigenous chickens be confined during rainy seasons to reduce their exposure to contaminated environment., Salmonellosis, caused by &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; species, is one of the most common foodborne illnesses worldwide with an estimated 93.8 million cases and about 155,00 fatalities. In both industrialized and developing nations, Salmonellosis has been reported to be one of the most prevalent foodborne zoonoses and is linked with arrays of illness syndromes such as acute and chronic enteritis, and septicaemia. The two major and most common &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; species implicated in both warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals are &lt;i&gt;Salmonella bongori&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica.&lt;/i&gt; To date, more than 2400 &lt;i&gt;S. enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovars which affect both humans and animals have been identified. &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; is further classified into serotypes based on three primary antigenic determinants: somatic (O), flagella (H), and capsular (K). The capacity of nearly all &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; species to infect, multiply, and survive in human host cells with the aid of their pathogenic and virulence arsenals makes them deadly and important public health pathogens. Primarily, food-producing animals such as poultry, swine, cattle, and their products have been identified as important sources of salmonellosis. Additionally, raw fruits and vegetables are among other food types that have been linked to the spread of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. Based on the clinical manifestation of human salmonellosis, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; strains can be categorized as either non-typhoidal &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; (NTS) and typhoidal &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;. The detection of aseptically collected &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; in necropsies, environmental samples, feedstuffs, rectal swabs, and food products serves as the basis for diagnosis. In developing nations, typhoid fever due to &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; Typhi typically results in the death of 5%-30% of those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) calculated that there are between 16 and 17 million typhoid cases worldwide each year, with scaring 600,000 deaths as a result. The contagiousness of a &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; outbreak depends on the bacterial strain, serovar, growth environment, and host susceptibility. Risk factors for &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; infection include a variety of foods; for example, contaminated chicken, beef, and pork. Globally, there is a growing incidence and emergence of life-threatening clinical cases, especially due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; spp, including strains exhibiting resistance to important antimicrobials such as beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins. In extreme cases, especially in situations involving very difficult-to-treat strains, death usually results. The severity of the infections resulting from &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; pathogens is dependent on the serovar type, host susceptibility, the type of bacterial strains, and growth environment. This review therefore aims to detail the nomenclature, etiology, history, pathogenesis, reservoir, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, risk factors, antimicrobial resistance, public health importance, economic impact, treatment, and control of salmonellosis.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Campylobacter is one of the most commonly reported foodborne pathogens in the United States. Because poultry is considered a major source of Campylobacter infections in humans, reduction of Campylobacter contamination in poultry products is likely the most important and effective public health strategy for reducing the burden of campylobacteriosis in humans. A comprehensive on-line survey was conducted of key stakeholders in the U.S. broiler industry, including broiler farm managers (n = 18), poultry veterinarians (n = 18), and processing plant managers (n = 20), to assess the current pre- and postharvest Campylobacter interventions and control measures practiced by the industry for reducing Campylobacter contamination of broiler products. The survey also included information regarding each respondent's understanding of Campylobacter transmission and ecology in relation to broiler production. The results revealed that a majority of the establishments included in the survey are following the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service guidelines for controlling Campylobacter contamination in broiler flocks and on carcasses. However, establishments appeared to be putting more effort into Salmonella control than into Campylobacter control both on the farm and in the processing plant. A majority of the respondents responded that current interventions are not effective for reducing Campylobacter contamination, especially on the farm. Many respondents did not understand the risk factors associated with Campylobacter colonization in broiler flocks and on carcasses. Continued educational and training programs for key stakeholders in the U.S. broiler industry are needed to increase awareness of the issues associated with Campylobacter infection in broiler chickens and of the fact that Campylobacter infection is a multifaceted problem that requires efforts from both the pre- and postharvest sectors., &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; is a major foodborne pathogen and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been described worldwide. The main objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and AMR of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from broilers throughout the supply chain in Valencia, Spain. A total of 483 samples were included in the analysis: 430 from the slaughterhouse (chicken carcass and neck skin) and 53 from the point of sale (retail broiler and packaging). Taking into account the origin of the sample, the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. was 19% in carcass, 28.2% in neck skin, 36.7% in retail broiler, and 80% in packaging isolates. The prevalence of different species in the analyzed samples was 21.1% and 4.8% for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter coli&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. AMR profiling of 125 &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; isolates revealed that 122 (97.6%) of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; samples presented high resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, 96.1% and 90.2% respectively, whereas &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; showed 87% of resistance to both antimicrobials. Both species were resistant to tetracycline (&lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; 84.3% and &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; 60.9%) and 26.1% of &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; was resistant to streptomycin. These results showed no significant difference in the frequency of AMR (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≥ 0.05) among isolates originated from different points in the food-processing chain at slaughterhouses and retail establishments. In contrast, three main patterns were detected: quinolone-tetracycline (64%), quinolone-only (17.6%), and quinolone-tetracycline-aminoglycosides (8%). Additionally, 12.8% of the isolates presented multidrug resistance, with significantly higher levels detected among &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; (30.4%) isolates compared with &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; (8.8%) and all the three strains were resistant to all six antibiotics tested. Therefore, these results indicate that broilers could be a source of antimicrobial-resistant &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; in humans and consequently pose a risk to public health., &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; is the most frequent foodborne zoonotic bacteria worldwide, with chicken meat being overwhelmingly the most important reservoir for human infections. Control measures implemented at the farm level (i.e., biosecurity or vaccination), which have been successfully applied to limit other pathogens, such as &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;, have not been effective in reducing &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; occurrence. Thus, new approaches are needed to fully understand the ecological interactions of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; with host animals to effectively comprehend its epidemiology. The objective of this study was to analyse longitudinally the gut microbiota composition of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;-infected and non-infected farms to identify any difference that could potentially be indicative of gut colonization by &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. Differences in the colonization rate and timing were observed at the farms that became positive for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; over the investigated time points, even though in positive tests, the occurrence of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; gut colonization was not observed before the second week of the life of the birds. Significant differences were observed in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa between the microbiota of individuals belonging to farms that became &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; positive during the study and those who remained negative with particular reference to &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidales&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Clostridiales&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; colonization dramatically influenced the microbiota richness, although to a different extent depending on the infection timing. Finally, a key role of &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; genera on the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; microbial network was observed. Understanding the ecology of the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; interaction with host microbiota during infection could support novel approaches for broiler microbial barrier restoration. Therefore, evidence obtained through this study can be used to identify options to reduce the incidence of infection at a primary production level based on the targeted influence of the intestinal microbiota, thus helping develop new control strategies in order to mitigate the risk of human exposure to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; by chicken meat consumption.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Salmonella, one of the most important foodborne pathogens, can be the cause of bacterial food-borne illness and is commonly associated with the consumption of retail meat. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates with high adaptability, have been responsible for many foodborne disease outbreaks. Here we present an investigation on the contamination and the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in retail meat obtained from supermarkets and from open markets in Guangxi, China. From the years 2009 to 2016, a total of 604 Salmonella isolates were recovered from a total of 3340 meat samples including 797 beef, 911 pork, 942 chicken and 690 duck, representing 18.08% of the samples tested. Pork was the most contaminated meat. Salmonella was detected in 322 samples from supermarkets and the positive rate of 21.03% was higher than that of 15.70% in 284 samples from open markets (P&lt;0.05). The prevalence of Salmonella in retail meat in the summer and fall months: June (2015, 40.63%), October (2012, 34.6%; 2016, 43.75%) was higher than in other seasons of the year. One hundred and twenty-seven serotypes were identified among the 604 Salmonella enterica isolates, and S. Derby (28.48%), S. Agona (9.77%), S. London (4.97%) and S. Enteritidis (4.47%) were the most common serotypes. Tests of susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents showed that 87.58% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and 57.79% exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR), as they were resistant to at least three antimicrobials. The presence of most of the antimicrobial-resistant genes tested was consistent with the resistant phenotypes found. Among all the antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs) examined in this study, bla&lt;sub&gt;TEM-1&lt;/sub&gt;, aadA1, cmlA, tetA, sul1 and sul2 were the most prevalent resistant genes in the multidrug resistant isolates. Our findings show that there was a trend that the Salmonella contamination in retail meat had increased and isolates showed an MDR phenotype and that the MDR had become more and more serious. Twenty-one isolates of S. Agona were randomly analyzed by using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) and six different types were found, indicating the existence of cross-contamination in the food market. The results indicate that the hazard analysis of the critical control points (HACCP) system for the whole food chain of retail meat should be further analyzed and improved., This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates. High levels of Salmonella contamination were detected in pork (67.0%), duck (50.5%) and chicken (46.2%). Thirty different serotypes were identified among 500 detected Salmonella isolates, as well as significant differences in serotypes between different retail meat samples. Notably, 405 (80.1%) isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). Meanwhile, we also found that 74 (14.8%) Salmonella isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the major mechanisms underlying this resistance were investigated. The commonest mutations in gyrA S83F (40.5%) and D87N (35.1%), and in parC was T57S (71.6%) and S80I (35.1%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that the S. Kentucky isolates that were resistant to ciprofloxacin mostly belonged to ST198 (21/23, 91.3%) and PFGE revealed the presence of various genotypes. This study identified a diversity of Salmonella serotypes and a high prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, which indicates that foodborne Salmonella potentially constitutes a potential food safety risk., This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates.

       "      <td>[The misuse of antibiotics in poultry farming is a global issue. The focus of this study was the health risk assessment of consumers from the determination of ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TC), and oxytetracycline (OTC) in broiler chicken in the raw, frozen, and boiled stages using solid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and ultraviolet detection (SPE-HPLC-UV). Chromatographic separation was achieved using 0.3% metaphosphoric acid and acetonitrile (1:10, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) for CIP at 280 nm and oxalic acid (0.01 M) and acetonitrile (1:1, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) for TC and OTC at 355 nm with different retention times. The method had an acceptable precision with good linearity, specificity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, and stability. Among a total of 252 raw samples, approximately 68.25%, 25.4%, and 7.54% contained CIP, TC, and OTC, respectively. Out of the positive raw samples, CIP exceeded the maximum residual limit (MRL) in 3.6% muscle, 14.3% liver and 17.9% skin samples, whereas TC and OTC were below the MRLs. The residual concentrations of these antibiotics were almost unchanged in frozen samples. After boiling the chicken samples, the TC and OTC residues were reduced significantly compared to CIP. Although the concentrations of CIP in boiled samples were above the MRL set by the European Union, these did not exceed the hazard index 1. Based on these results, the exposure levels to antibiotics in broiler chicken meats may be considered to have a low risk for human health., In a market environment where food safety problems still occur despite repeated prohibitions, food safety problems caused by veterinary drug residues and biological safety problems caused by the transfer of drug resistance have attracted much attention. Herein, a method based on a compound purification system coupled with direct analysis in real time-tandem mass spectrometry (DART-MS/MS) was established to determine 41 different types of veterinary drug residues in livestock and poultry products. First, a single-standard solution sampling method was used to optimize the selection of the best quasi-molecular ion, two daughter ions, and their cone-hole and collision voltages; qualitative and quantitative ion pairs are composed of a quasi-molecular ion and its corresponding daughter ion. The abundance ratios of the drug compounds in standard solutions of the solvent and matrix mixtures were then calculated according to the requirements of the European Union 2002/657 specification. DART-MS/MS was subsequently developed for the accurate characterization and quantitative analysis of the veterinary drugs. Finally, a composite purification pretreatment system was formed by combining the primary secondary amine (PSA) and octadecyl bonded silica gel (C18) of a QuEChERS technology with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to achieve the one-step purification of the drug compounds. The influence of the key parameters of the DART ion source on the determination of the drugs was investigated using the peak areas of the quantitative ions as the criterion. The optimum conditions were as follows: ion source temperature of 350 ℃, 12-Dip-it Samplers module, sample injection speed of 0.6 mm/s, and external vacuum pump pressure of -75 kPa. According to the differences in the dissociation constant (p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) ranges of the 41 types of veterinary drug compounds and the characteristics of the sample matrixes, the extraction solvent, matrix-dispersing solvent, and purification method were optimized based on the recovery. The extraction solvent was 1.0% acetonitrile formate solution, and the pretreatment column included MWCNTs containing 50 mg of PSA and 50 mg of C18. The three chloramphenicol drugs showed a linear relationship in the ranges of 0.5-20 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9995-0.9997,and the detection and quantification limits of three chloramphenicol drugs were 0.1 and 0.5 μg/kg, respectively. The 38 other drugs, including quinolones, sulfonamides, and nitro-imidazoles showed a linear relationship in the ranges of 2-200 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9979-0.9999, and the detection and quantification limits of the 38 other drugs were 0.5 and 2.0 μg/kg, respectively. The recoveries of the 41 veterinary drugs at low, medium, and high spiked levels in chicken, pork, beef, and mutton samples were 80.0%-109.6%, with intra- and inter-day precisions of 0.3%-6.8% and 0.4%-7.0%, respectively. A total of 100 batches of animal meat (pork, chicken, beef, and mutton; 25 batches each) and known positive samples were simultaneously analyzed using the national standard method and the detection method established in this study. Sulfadiazine (89.2, 78.1, and 105.3 μg/kg) was detected in three batches of pork samples, and sarafloxacin (56.3, 102.0 μg/kg) was detected in two batches of chicken samples and no veterinary drugs were detected in the other samples; both methods yielded consistent results for known positive samples. The proposed method is rapid, simple, sensitive, environmentally friendly, and suitable for the simultaneous screening and detection of multiple veterinary drug residues in animal meat., The misuse of antibiotics in poultry farming is a global issue.

       "      <td>[China is one of the highest producers of poultry meat output in the world, with a large scale of chicken rearing. Statistically analyzed H9N2-subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have become the dominant subtype in China's live poultry market, with the highest detection rate. Although H9N2 AIV is of low pathogenicity and tends not to cause serious disease and high mortality in poultry, it poses a great challenge to the domestic poultry farming industry by causing a decrease in appetite, a decline in egg production, and deaths caused by mixed infections with another pathogenic microorganism. Moreover, novel influenza viruses (H7N9 and H3N8) infecting humans have emerged in China, and the H9N2 AIV provides all or part of the internal genes to the new recombinant viruses, posing a potential threat to public health and safety and human health. In this research, six H9N2 AIVs were isolated from feces or oropharyngeal swabs collected from live poultry markets and duck farms in Zhanjiang. After epidemiological investigations, phylogenetic analyses, and molecular characterization, we found that the ZJ81 strain was a chicken-human-mink recombinant virus, the ML3 strain was a chicken-human recombinant virus, and all six virus strains of the virus had a bias for the human receptor-binding site and a mutation that could cause an increase in virulence in mice. Therefore, surveillance and control of H9N2 AIV should be strengthened to provide data support for cross-species transmission of H9N2 AIV., H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has low-pathogenicity but causes respiratory symptoms and drop in egg production in chicken with long-term virus shedding, resulting in great economic losses due to high mortality related to secondary infection with other pathogens. In recent years, H9N2 viruses have been posing a threat to public health, causing human infection in China. Compared to studies on other AIV subtypes, there are relatively few studies on the pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus in mammals. H9N2 subtype AIV has been circulating worldwide in many avian species and transmitting with high efficiency in poultry. It can provide internal genes for other subtypes to produce new viruses, causing a pandemic risk. It is important to carry out long-term surveillance and pathogenic characteristics of the H9N2 virus. In this study, we conducted environmental surveillance of live poultry markets in Anhui province from 2013 to 2018, and 33 representative environmental isolates were selected and studied systematically. The genomic RNA of Anhui H9N2 isolates was subjected to RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing analysis. Thirty-three strains were isolated from the embryonated eggs of specific-pathogen-free chickens. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that h9.4.2.5-like H9N2 viruses were predominant during 2013-2018 and acquired multiple specific amino acid mutations that may have increased their affinity for mammals and enhanced their infectivity and transmissibility. Additionally, six internal genes of H9N2 clustered together with the novel human-lethal reassortant viruses, such as the low-pathogenicity H7N9, H10N8, and Anhui H5N6 viruses, and even HPAI H7N9. Because H9N2 viruses may be the donors of internal genes that lead to the generation of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced pathogenicity in Anhui province, continuous environmental surveillance of live poultry markets, a key source of reassorted H9N2 and other avian influenza viruses, is of great importance., H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has low-pathogenicity but causes respiratory symptoms and drop in egg production in chicken with long-term virus shedding, resulting in great economic losses due to high mortality related to secondary infection with other pathogens.

       "0  [Poultry is thriving across the globe. Chicken meat is the most preferred poultry worldwide, and its popularity is increasing. However, poultry also threatens human hygiene, especially as a fomite of infectious diseases caused by the major foodborne pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Listeria). Preventing pathogenic bacterial biofilm is crucial in the chicken industry due to increasing food safety hazards caused by recurring contamination and the rapid degradation of meat, as well as the increased resistance of bacteria to cleaning and disinfection procedures commonly used in chicken processing plants. To address this, various innovative and promising strategies to combat bacterial resistance and biofilm are emerging to improve food safety and quality and extend shelf-life. In particular, natural compounds are attractive because of their potential antimicrobial activities. Natural compounds can also boost the immune system and improve poultry health and performance. In addition to phytochemicals, bacteriophages, nanoparticles, coatings, enzymes, and probiotics represent unique and environmentally friendly strategies in the poultry processing industry to prevent foodborne pathogens from reaching the consumer. Lactoferrin, bacteriocin, antimicrobial peptides, cell-free supernatants, and biosurfactants are also of considerable interest for their prospective application as natural antimicrobials for improving the safety of raw poultry meat. This review aims to describe the feasibility of these proposed strategies and provide an overview of recent published evidences to control microorganisms in the poultry industry, considering the human health, food safety, and economic aspects of poultry production., Food borne diseases are one of the major human disease conditions worldwide. Most of them are of bacterial origin and chickens are a major source of such bacteria; they are consumed at high rate worldwide and tend to harbor the zoonotic bacteria without showing signs of illness. Running rain water tends to increase environmental contamination, since it carries various substances from one area to another; this results in village-indigenous chickens picking more bacteria from the environment as they roam/scavenge around for food. Thus, after the rain, the chickens' intestinal contents may contain more bacteria quantity-wise and type-wise. This study was carried-out to determine whether that was the case after heavy rains of 2018.120 intestine samples were collected from indigenous chickens from three slaughterhouses in Nairobi for bacterial quantification using the Miles and Misra technique; bacterial isolation and identification were carried out using standard bacteriological procedures. Intestines from the slaughterhouses had different mean bacterial counts: Kangemi had the highest (1.3 × 10<sup>12</sup> colony-forming units per ml), followed by Burma (5.6 × 10<sup>11</sup>), then Kariokor (4.7 × 10<sup>11</sup>). <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> was the most isolated at 85.8%, followed by genera <i>Staphylococcus</i> (55%), <i>Streptococcus</i> (43.3%), <i>Bacillus</i> (41.66%), <i>Listeria</i> (38.3%), <i>Proteus</i> (24.16%), <i>Klebsiella</i> (7.5%), <i>Campylobacter</i> (2.5%), <i>Pseudomonas</i> (6%), and <i>Streptobacillus</i> (0.83%). The study showed that the indigenous chickens carry a variety of bacteria in types and numbers, some of them being zoonotic. Apart from picking more bacteria as a result of environmental contamination during rainy season, the weather and bird-handling further stress the birds, thus contributing to higher bacterial multiplication and higher bacterial carriage. If slaughter is not done right, these intestinal bacteria can easily cause contamination of respective chicken meat; thus, if pathogenic, it can cause food poisoning to consumers of the meat. Therefore, it is recommended that precaution be taken while slaughtering chickens for consumption. In addition, where possible, free-range indigenous chickens be confined during rainy seasons to reduce their exposure to contaminated environment., Salmonellosis, caused by <i>Salmonella</i> species, is one of the most common foodborne illnesses worldwide with an estimated 93.8 million cases and about 155,00 fatalities. In both industrialized and developing nations, Salmonellosis has been reported to be one of the most prevalent foodborne zoonoses and is linked with arrays of illness syndromes such as acute and chronic enteritis, and septicaemia. The two major and most common <i>Salmonella</i> species implicated in both warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals are <i>Salmonella bongori</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica.</i> To date, more than 2400 <i>S. enterica</i> serovars which affect both humans and animals have been identified. <i>Salmonella</i> is further classified into serotypes based on three primary antigenic determinants: somatic (O), flagella (H), and capsular (K). The capacity of nearly all <i>Salmonella</i> species to infect, multiply, and survive in human host cells with the aid of their pathogenic and virulence arsenals makes them deadly and important public health pathogens. Primarily, food-producing animals such as poultry, swine, cattle, and their products have been identified as important sources of salmonellosis. Additionally, raw fruits and vegetables are among other food types that have been linked to the spread of <i>Salmonella</i> spp. Based on the clinical manifestation of human salmonellosis, <i>Salmonella</i> strains can be categorized as either non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> (NTS) and typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i>. The detection of aseptically collected <i>Salmonella</i> in necropsies, environmental samples, feedstuffs, rectal swabs, and food products serves as the basis for diagnosis. In developing nations, typhoid fever due to <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi typically results in the death of 5%-30% of those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) calculated that there are between 16 and 17 million typhoid cases worldwide each year, with scaring 600,000 deaths as a result. The contagiousness of a <i>Salmonella</i> outbreak depends on the bacterial strain, serovar, growth environment, and host susceptibility. Risk factors for <i>Salmonella</i> infection include a variety of foods; for example, contaminated chicken, beef, and pork. Globally, there is a growing incidence and emergence of life-threatening clinical cases, especially due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Salmonella</i> spp, including strains exhibiting resistance to important antimicrobials such as beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins. In extreme cases, especially in situations involving very difficult-to-treat strains, death usually results. The severity of the infections resulting from <i>Salmonella</i> pathogens is dependent on the serovar type, host susceptibility, the type of bacterial strains, and growth environment. This review therefore aims to detail the nomenclature, etiology, history, pathogenesis, reservoir, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, risk factors, antimicrobial resistance, public health importance, economic impact, treatment, and control of salmonellosis.]  \n",

Because poultry is considered a major source of Campylobacter infections in humans, reduction of Campylobacter contamination in poultry products is likely the most important and effective public health strategy for reducing the burden of campylobacteriosis in humans. A comprehensive on-line survey was conducted of key stakeholders in the U.S. broiler industry, including broiler farm managers (n = 18), poultry veterinarians (n = 18), and processing plant managers (n = 20), to assess the current pre- and postharvest Campylobacter interventions and control measures practiced by the industry for reducing Campylobacter contamination of broiler products. The survey also included information regarding each respondent's understanding of Campylobacter transmission and ecology in relation to broiler production. The results revealed that a majority of the establishments included in the survey are following the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service guidelines for controlling Campylobacter contamination in broiler flocks and on carcasses. However, establishments appeared to be putting more effort into Salmonella control than into Campylobacter control both on the farm and in the processing plant. A majority of the respondents responded that current interventions are not effective for reducing Campylobacter contamination, especially on the farm. Many respondents did not understand the risk factors associated with Campylobacter colonization in broiler flocks and on carcasses. Continued educational and training programs for key stakeholders in the U.S. broiler industry are needed to increase awareness of the issues associated with Campylobacter infection in broiler chickens and of the fact that Campylobacter infection is a multifaceted problem that requires efforts from both the pre- and postharvest sectors., <i>Campylobacter</i> is a major foodborne pathogen and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been described worldwide. The main objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and AMR of <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. isolated from broilers throughout the supply chain in Valencia, Spain. A total of 483 samples were included in the analysis: 430 from the slaughterhouse (chicken carcass and neck skin) and 53 from the point of sale (retail broiler and packaging). Taking into account the origin of the sample, the prevalence of <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. was 19% in carcass, 28.2% in neck skin, 36.7% in retail broiler, and 80% in packaging isolates. The prevalence of different species in the analyzed samples was 21.1% and 4.8% for <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> and <i>Campylobacter coli</i>, respectively. AMR profiling of 125 <i>Campylobacter</i> isolates revealed that 122 (97.6%) of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. <i>C. jejuni</i> samples presented high resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, 96.1% and 90.2% respectively, whereas <i>C. coli</i> showed 87% of resistance to both antimicrobials. Both species were resistant to tetracycline (<i>C. jejuni</i> 84.3% and <i>C. coli</i> 60.9%) and 26.1% of <i>C. coli</i> was resistant to streptomycin. These results showed no significant difference in the frequency of AMR (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05) among isolates originated from different points in the food-processing chain at slaughterhouses and retail establishments. In contrast, three main patterns were detected: quinolone-tetracycline (64%), quinolone-only (17.6%), and quinolone-tetracycline-aminoglycosides (8%). Additionally, 12.8% of the isolates presented multidrug resistance, with significantly higher levels detected among <i>C. coli</i> (30.4%) isolates compared with <i>C. jejuni</i> (8.8%) and all the three strains were resistant to all six antibiotics tested. Therefore, these results indicate that broilers could be a source of antimicrobial-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> in humans and consequently pose a risk to public health., <i>Campylobacter</i> is the most frequent foodborne zoonotic bacteria worldwide, with chicken meat being overwhelmingly the most important reservoir for human infections. Control measures implemented at the farm level (i.e., biosecurity or vaccination), which have been successfully applied to limit other pathogens, such as <i>Salmonella</i>, have not been effective in reducing <i>Campylobacter</i> occurrence. Thus, new approaches are needed to fully understand the ecological interactions of <i>Campylobacter</i> with host animals to effectively comprehend its epidemiology. The objective of this study was to analyse longitudinally the gut microbiota composition of <i>Campylobacter</i>-infected and non-infected farms to identify any difference that could potentially be indicative of gut colonization by <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. Differences in the colonization rate and timing were observed at the farms that became positive for <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> over the investigated time points, even though in positive tests, the occurrence of <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> gut colonization was not observed before the second week of the life of the birds. Significant differences were observed in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa between the microbiota of individuals belonging to farms that became <i>Campylobacter</i> positive during the study and those who remained negative with particular reference to <i>Bacteroidales</i> and <i>Clostridiales</i>, respectively. Moreover, <i>Campylobacter</i> colonization dramatically influenced the microbiota richness, although to a different extent depending on the infection timing. Finally, a key role of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> genera on the <i>Campylobacter</i> microbial network was observed. Understanding the ecology of the <i>Campylobacter</i> interaction with host microbiota during infection could support novel approaches for broiler microbial barrier restoration. Therefore, evidence obtained through this study can be used to identify options to reduce the incidence of infection at a primary production level based on the targeted influence of the intestinal microbiota, thus helping develop new control strategies in order to mitigate the risk of human exposure to <i>Campylobacter</i> by chicken meat consumption.]  \n",

Multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates with high adaptability, have been responsible for many foodborne disease outbreaks. Here we present an investigation on the contamination and the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in retail meat obtained from supermarkets and from open markets in Guangxi, China. From the years 2009 to 2016, a total of 604 Salmonella isolates were recovered from a total of 3340 meat samples including 797 beef, 911 pork, 942 chicken and 690 duck, representing 18.08% of the samples tested. Pork was the most contaminated meat. Salmonella was detected in 322 samples from supermarkets and the positive rate of 21.03% was higher than that of 15.70% in 284 samples from open markets (P<0.05). The prevalence of Salmonella in retail meat in the summer and fall months: June (2015, 40.63%), October (2012, 34.6%; 2016, 43.75%) was higher than in other seasons of the year. One hundred and twenty-seven serotypes were identified among the 604 Salmonella enterica isolates, and S. Derby (28.48%), S. Agona (9.77%), S. London (4.97%) and S. Enteritidis (4.47%) were the most common serotypes. Tests of susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents showed that 87.58% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and 57.79% exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR), as they were resistant to at least three antimicrobials. The presence of most of the antimicrobial-resistant genes tested was consistent with the resistant phenotypes found. Among all the antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs) examined in this study, bla<sub>TEM-1</sub>, aadA1, cmlA, tetA, sul1 and sul2 were the most prevalent resistant genes in the multidrug resistant isolates. Our findings show that there was a trend that the Salmonella contamination in retail meat had increased and isolates showed an MDR phenotype and that the MDR had become more and more serious. Twenty-one isolates of S. Agona were randomly analyzed by using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) and six different types were found, indicating the existence of cross-contamination in the food market. The results indicate that the hazard analysis of the critical control points (HACCP) system for the whole food chain of retail meat should be further analyzed and improved., This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates. High levels of Salmonella contamination were detected in pork (67.0%), duck (50.5%) and chicken (46.2%). Thirty different serotypes were identified among 500 detected Salmonella isolates, as well as significant differences in serotypes between different retail meat samples. Notably, 405 (80.1%) isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). Meanwhile, we also found that 74 (14.8%) Salmonella isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the major mechanisms underlying this resistance were investigated. The commonest mutations in gyrA S83F (40.5%) and D87N (35.1%), and in parC was T57S (71.6%) and S80I (35.1%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that the S. Kentucky isolates that were resistant to ciprofloxacin mostly belonged to ST198 (21/23, 91.3%) and PFGE revealed the presence of various genotypes. This study identified a diversity of Salmonella serotypes and a high prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, which indicates that foodborne Salmonella potentially constitutes a potential food safety risk., This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates.

The focus of this study was the health risk assessment of consumers from the determination of ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TC), and oxytetracycline (OTC) in broiler chicken in the raw, frozen, and boiled stages using solid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and ultraviolet detection (SPE-HPLC-UV). Chromatographic separation was achieved using 0.3% metaphosphoric acid and acetonitrile (1:10, <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) for CIP at 280 nm and oxalic acid (0.01 M) and acetonitrile (1:1, <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) for TC and OTC at 355 nm with different retention times. The method had an acceptable precision with good linearity, specificity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, and stability. Among a total of 252 raw samples, approximately 68.25%, 25.4%, and 7.54% contained CIP, TC, and OTC, respectively. Out of the positive raw samples, CIP exceeded the maximum residual limit (MRL) in 3.6% muscle, 14.3% liver and 17.9% skin samples, whereas TC and OTC were below the MRLs. The residual concentrations of these antibiotics were almost unchanged in frozen samples. After boiling the chicken samples, the TC and OTC residues were reduced significantly compared to CIP. Although the concentrations of CIP in boiled samples were above the MRL set by the European Union, these did not exceed the hazard index 1. Based on these results, the exposure levels to antibiotics in broiler chicken meats may be considered to have a low risk for human health., In a market environment where food safety problems still occur despite repeated prohibitions, food safety problems caused by veterinary drug residues and biological safety problems caused by the transfer of drug resistance have attracted much attention. Herein, a method based on a compound purification system coupled with direct analysis in real time-tandem mass spectrometry (DART-MS/MS) was established to determine 41 different types of veterinary drug residues in livestock and poultry products. First, a single-standard solution sampling method was used to optimize the selection of the best quasi-molecular ion, two daughter ions, and their cone-hole and collision voltages; qualitative and quantitative ion pairs are composed of a quasi-molecular ion and its corresponding daughter ion. The abundance ratios of the drug compounds in standard solutions of the solvent and matrix mixtures were then calculated according to the requirements of the European Union 2002/657 specification. DART-MS/MS was subsequently developed for the accurate characterization and quantitative analysis of the veterinary drugs. Finally, a composite purification pretreatment system was formed by combining the primary secondary amine (PSA) and octadecyl bonded silica gel (C18) of a QuEChERS technology with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to achieve the one-step purification of the drug compounds. The influence of the key parameters of the DART ion source on the determination of the drugs was investigated using the peak areas of the quantitative ions as the criterion. The optimum conditions were as follows: ion source temperature of 350 ℃, 12-Dip-it Samplers module, sample injection speed of 0.6 mm/s, and external vacuum pump pressure of -75 kPa. According to the differences in the dissociation constant (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>) ranges of the 41 types of veterinary drug compounds and the characteristics of the sample matrixes, the extraction solvent, matrix-dispersing solvent, and purification method were optimized based on the recovery. The extraction solvent was 1.0% acetonitrile formate solution, and the pretreatment column included MWCNTs containing 50 mg of PSA and 50 mg of C18. The three chloramphenicol drugs showed a linear relationship in the ranges of 0.5-20 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9995-0.9997,and the detection and quantification limits of three chloramphenicol drugs were 0.1 and 0.5 μg/kg, respectively. The 38 other drugs, including quinolones, sulfonamides, and nitro-imidazoles showed a linear relationship in the ranges of 2-200 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9979-0.9999, and the detection and quantification limits of the 38 other drugs were 0.5 and 2.0 μg/kg, respectively. The recoveries of the 41 veterinary drugs at low, medium, and high spiked levels in chicken, pork, beef, and mutton samples were 80.0%-109.6%, with intra- and inter-day precisions of 0.3%-6.8% and 0.4%-7.0%, respectively. A total of 100 batches of animal meat (pork, chicken, beef, and mutton; 25 batches each) and known positive samples were simultaneously analyzed using the national standard method and the detection method established in this study. Sulfadiazine (89.2, 78.1, and 105.3 μg/kg) was detected in three batches of pork samples, and sarafloxacin (56.3, 102.0 μg/kg) was detected in two batches of chicken samples and no veterinary drugs were detected in the other samples; both methods yielded consistent results for known positive samples. The proposed method is rapid, simple, sensitive, environmentally friendly, and suitable for the simultaneous screening and detection of multiple veterinary drug residues in animal meat., The misuse of antibiotics in poultry farming is a global issue.

Statistically analyzed H9N2-subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have become the dominant subtype in China's live poultry market, with the highest detection rate. Although H9N2 AIV is of low pathogenicity and tends not to cause serious disease and high mortality in poultry, it poses a great challenge to the domestic poultry farming industry by causing a decrease in appetite, a decline in egg production, and deaths caused by mixed infections with another pathogenic microorganism. Moreover, novel influenza viruses (H7N9 and H3N8) infecting humans have emerged in China, and the H9N2 AIV provides all or part of the internal genes to the new recombinant viruses, posing a potential threat to public health and safety and human health. In this research, six H9N2 AIVs were isolated from feces or oropharyngeal swabs collected from live poultry markets and duck farms in Zhanjiang. After epidemiological investigations, phylogenetic analyses, and molecular characterization, we found that the ZJ81 strain was a chicken-human-mink recombinant virus, the ML3 strain was a chicken-human recombinant virus, and all six virus strains of the virus had a bias for the human receptor-binding site and a mutation that could cause an increase in virulence in mice. Therefore, surveillance and control of H9N2 AIV should be strengthened to provide data support for cross-species transmission of H9N2 AIV., H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has low-pathogenicity but causes respiratory symptoms and drop in egg production in chicken with long-term virus shedding, resulting in great economic losses due to high mortality related to secondary infection with other pathogens. In recent years, H9N2 viruses have been posing a threat to public health, causing human infection in China. Compared to studies on other AIV subtypes, there are relatively few studies on the pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus in mammals. H9N2 subtype AIV has been circulating worldwide in many avian species and transmitting with high efficiency in poultry. It can provide internal genes for other subtypes to produce new viruses, causing a pandemic risk. It is important to carry out long-term surveillance and pathogenic characteristics of the H9N2 virus. In this study, we conducted environmental surveillance of live poultry markets in Anhui province from 2013 to 2018, and 33 representative environmental isolates were selected and studied systematically. The genomic RNA of Anhui H9N2 isolates was subjected to RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing analysis. Thirty-three strains were isolated from the embryonated eggs of specific-pathogen-free chickens. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that h9.4.2.5-like H9N2 viruses were predominant during 2013-2018 and acquired multiple specific amino acid mutations that may have increased their affinity for mammals and enhanced their infectivity and transmissibility. Additionally, six internal genes of H9N2 clustered together with the novel human-lethal reassortant viruses, such as the low-pathogenicity H7N9, H10N8, and Anhui H5N6 viruses, and even HPAI H7N9. Because H9N2 viruses may be the donors of internal genes that lead to the generation of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced pathogenicity in Anhui province, continuous environmental surveillance of live poultry markets, a key source of reassorted H9N2 and other avian influenza viruses, is of great importance., H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has low-pathogenicity but causes respiratory symptoms and drop in egg production in chicken with long-term virus shedding, resulting in great economic losses due to high mortality related to secondary infection with other pathogens.

       "      <td>Globally, chicken is known to be a reservoir for the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes to humans. In Nigeria, antimicrobial drugs are readily accessible for use in poultry production, either for preventive or therapeutic purposes. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (ESBL-EC) are transmissible to humans because of their zoonotic potentials. People working very closely with chickens either on farms or markets are at greater risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and zoonotic transmission of ESBL-EC among poultry-workers, chickens, and poultry environments in Abuja, Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers, chickens and poultry environment in selected farms/chicken markets in Abuja. Stool, faecal, and environmental samples were collected from apparently healthy workers, chickens, and farm/market environments from December 2018 to April 2019. Data were collected electronically using an open data kit (ODK) installed on a Smartphone. Antimicrobial resistance was determined using broth micro-dilution methods against a panel of 14 antimicrobial agents. We carried out the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the isolates. Data were analyzed by computing frequencies, proportions and spearman's correlation (ρ). Of 429 samples, 26.8% (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 115) were positive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli (E. coli)&lt;/i&gt;. Of the 115 &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; isolates, 32.2% (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 37) were confirmed ESBL producers by phenotypic characterization. Prevalence of ESBL-EC was highest among both poultry-workers (37.8%; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 14) and chickens (37.8%; n = 14) followed by the environment (24.3%; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 9). Both human and chicken isolates showed similar patterns of multidrug resistance to tested antimicrobials with a positive correlation (ρ = 0.91). Among ESBL producers, we observed the dissemination of &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;CTX-M (10.8%; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4) genes. The coexistence of &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;CTX-M-15 and &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;TEM-1 genes was observed in 8.1% (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3) of the isolates, out of which (66.7%; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2) were chicken isolates from the farm, while a single human isolate was from the chicken market. ESBL-EC isolates were prevalent amongst apparently healthy individuals, chickens and the poultry farm/market environment in Abuja. It is important to educate healthcare workers that people in proximity with poultry are a high-risk group for faecal carriage of ESBL-EC, hence pose a higher risk to the general population for the spread of antimicrobial resistance.</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Antimicrobial resistance in bacteria is the most urgent global threat to public health, with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) being one of the most documented examples. Nonetheless, the ESBL-E. coli transmission relationship among clinical sites and chicken farms remains unclear. Here, 408 ESBL-E. coli strains were isolated from hospitals and chicken farms in Sichuan Province and Yunnan Province in 2021. We detected &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; genes in 337 (82.62%) ESBL-E. coli strains. Although the isolation rate, prevalent sequence type (ST) subtypes, and &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt; gene subtypes of ESBL-E. coli varied based on regions and sources, a few strains of CTX-ESBL-E. coli derived from clinical sites and chicken farms in Sichuan Province displayed high genetic similarity. This indicates a risk of ESBL-E. coli transmission from chickens to humans. Moreover, we found that the high-risk clonal strains ST131 and ST1193 primarily carried &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M-27&lt;/sub&gt;. This indicates that drug-resistant E. coli from animal and human sources should be monitored. As well, the overuse of β-lactam antibiotics should be avoided in poultry farms to ensure public health and build an effective regulatory mechanism of \"farm to fork\" under a One Health perspective. &lt;b&gt;IMPORTANCE&lt;/b&gt; Bacterial drug resistance has become one of the most significant threats to human health worldwide, especially for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli). Timely and accurate epidemiological surveys can provide scientific guidance for the adoption of treatments in different regions and also reduce the formation of drug-resistant bacteria. Our study showed that the subtypes of ESBL-E. coli strains prevalent in different provinces are somewhat different, so it is necessary to individualize treatment regimens in different regions, and it is especially important to limit and reduce antibiotic use in poultry farming since chicken-derived ESBL-E. coli serves as an important reservoir of drug resistance genes and has the potential to spread to humans, thus posing a threat to human health. The use of antibiotics in poultry farming should be particularly limited and reduced., Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an emerging pathogen of high concern given its resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Broiler chicken, which is the number one consumed meat in the United States and worldwide, can be a reservoir of ESBL E. coli. Backyard poultry ownership is on the rise in the United States, yet there is little research investigating prevalence of ESBL E. coli in this setting. This study aims to identify the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles (phenotypically and genotypically) of ESBL E. coli in some backyard and commercial broiler farms in the U.S. For this study ten backyard and ten commercial farms were visited at three time-points across flock production. Fecal (n = 10), litter/compost (n = 5), soil (n = 5), and swabs of feeders and waterers (n = 6) were collected at each visit and processed for E. coli. Assessment of ESBL phenotype was determined through using disk diffusion with 3rd generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and that with clavulanic acid. Broth microdilution and whole genome sequencing were used to investigate both phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles, respectively. ESBL E. coli was more prevalent in backyard farms with 12.95% of samples testing positive whereas 0.77% of commercial farm samples were positive. All isolates contained a blaCTX-M gene, the dominant variant being blaCTX-M-1, and its presence was entirely due to plasmids. Our study confirms concerns of growing resistance to fourth generation cephalosporin, cefepime, as roughly half (51.4%) of all isolates were found to be susceptible dose-dependent and few were resistant. Resistance to non-beta lactams, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, was also detected in our samples. Our study identifies prevalence of blaCTX-M type ESBL E. coli in U.S. backyard broiler farms, emphasizing the need for interventions for food and production safety., Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an emerging pathogen of high concern given its resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins.

       "      <td>Childhood stunting and malnutrition condemn millions of people globally to a life of disadvantage and cognitive and physical impairment. Though increasing egg consumption is often seen as an important solution for low and middle income countries (including Ethiopia), emerging evidence suggests that greater exposure to poultry feces may also inhibit child growth due to the effects of enteric bacteria, especially &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;, on gut health. In this rapid ethnographic study, we explored village poultry production, child dietary practices, and environmental hygiene conditions as they relate to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; risk and intervention in 16 villages in Haramaya Woreda, Eastern Ethiopia. In the study area, we found that women assumed primary responsibility to care for both chickens and children: in feeding, housing, and healthcare. Most chickens were free-range local indigenous breeds, and flock sizes were small and unstable due to epidemics, seasonal trends, reproductive patterns, and lack of food. Generally, eggs were seen as \"too luxurious\" to be eaten, and were predominantly sold at local markets for scarce cash, despite high malnutrition rates. Local narratives of extreme poverty, social dietary norms, parental fatalism, and lack of \"dietary consciousness\" (as it was called) were invoked to explain this. We found that homesteads were highly contaminated with human and animal feces. Although community members viewed chicken feces and poultry gastrointestinal contents as particularly noxious in comparison to other animals because of their feeding behaviour, they did not relate them to any particular disease. Shared human-animal housing and childcare practices place children at high risk of exposure to enteric bacteria from animal manure, despite daily routines designed to manage the domestic landscape. Addressing childhood stunting and malnutrition through egg production in rural landscapes like Haramaya must navigate three distinct health and care regimes: for children, chickens, and home environments. Interventions should be based on a holistic approach to social and economic empowerment, one that considers both women and men and integrates nutrition, health, and community change as its overarching goal.</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Childhood stunting and malnutrition condemn millions of people globally to a life of disadvantage and cognitive and physical impairment. Though increasing egg consumption is often seen as an important solution for low and middle income countries (including Ethiopia), emerging evidence suggests that greater exposure to poultry feces may also inhibit child growth due to the effects of enteric bacteria, especially &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;, on gut health. In this rapid ethnographic study, we explored village poultry production, child dietary practices, and environmental hygiene conditions as they relate to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; risk and intervention in 16 villages in Haramaya Woreda, Eastern Ethiopia. In the study area, we found that women assumed primary responsibility to care for both chickens and children: in feeding, housing, and healthcare. Most chickens were free-range local indigenous breeds, and flock sizes were small and unstable due to epidemics, seasonal trends, reproductive patterns, and lack of food. Generally, eggs were seen as \"too luxurious\" to be eaten, and were predominantly sold at local markets for scarce cash, despite high malnutrition rates. Local narratives of extreme poverty, social dietary norms, parental fatalism, and lack of \"dietary consciousness\" (as it was called) were invoked to explain this. We found that homesteads were highly contaminated with human and animal feces. Although community members viewed chicken feces and poultry gastrointestinal contents as particularly noxious in comparison to other animals because of their feeding behaviour, they did not relate them to any particular disease. Shared human-animal housing and childcare practices place children at high risk of exposure to enteric bacteria from animal manure, despite daily routines designed to manage the domestic landscape. Addressing childhood stunting and malnutrition through egg production in rural landscapes like Haramaya must navigate three distinct health and care regimes: for children, chickens, and home environments. Interventions should be based on a holistic approach to social and economic empowerment, one that considers both women and men and integrates nutrition, health, and community change as its overarching goal., According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre report on global human displacement, Ethiopia has the highest number of newly displaced people forced to flee their homes. Displaced people have arrived in other regions, sometimes leading to conflict. Several regions in Ethiopia experience on-going ethnic tensions and violence between tribes, which leaves smallholder farmers suspicious of any outside activities in their locale, assuming other ethnic groups may harm them. Changes in the central Ethiopian government have also led to suspicion of non-local agencies. The &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; Genomics and Enteric Dysfunction (CAGED) research project's objective is to improve the incomes, livelihoods and nutrition of smallholder farmers and was conducted during this period of increasing violence. The project aims to assess the impact of reducing exposure to chicken excreta on young children's gut health and growth. This paper does not report empirical findings from CAGED, but is part of a series that aims to identify challenges in humanitarian research and reports on mitigation strategies during this research. This research is important to determine whether &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; infection in chicken's contributes to illness and stunting in children. However, violence against other researchers in different parts of Ethiopia led to mistrust and lack of engagement by the community with the researchers. Some reactions were so hostile that the team was fearful about returning to some households. As a result, the team designed strategies to respond, including establishing two types of community advisory boards. One used pre-existing village elder structures and another was composed of village youth. Data collection team members received training in principles of ethics, consent, and crisis management, and were provided on-going support from local and international principal investigators and the study's ethics advisor. The hostility and mistrust led to fear among the data collectors. These and the resulting strategies to address them resulted in delays for the research. However, the interventions taken resulted in successful completion of the field activities. Moreover, the lessons learned from this project are already being implemented with other projects being conducted in various parts of Ethiopia., According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre report on global human displacement, Ethiopia has the highest number of newly displaced people forced to flee their homes.

       "      <td>Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins, dioxin-like chemicals and non-dioxin-like PCBs causing adverse effects to human health bio-accumulate through the food web due to their affinity for adipose tissues. Foods of animal origin are therefore the main contributors to human dietary exposure. The European Union's (EU) food safety policy requires checking of a wide range of samples for compliance with legal limits on a regular basis. Several methods of varying efficiency are applied by official control laboratories for extraction of the different classes of lipids and associated POPs, bound to animal tissue and animal products in varying degrees, sometimes leading to discrepancies especially in fresh weight based analytical results. Starting from &lt;i&gt;Smedes'&lt;/i&gt; lipid extraction from marine tissue, we optimized the extraction efficiency for both lipids and lipophilic pollutants, abandoning the time-consuming centrifugation step. The resulting modified &lt;i&gt;Smedes&lt;/i&gt; extraction (MSE) method was validated based on multiple analyses of a large number of real world samples, matrix calibration and performance assessment in proficiency testing utilizing both instrumental and bioanalytical methodologies. Intermediate precision in 12 different foods was below 3% in chicken eggs, egg powder, animal fat, fish, fish oil, poultry, whole milk, milk fat and milk powder, and below 5% in bovine meat, liver, and infant food. In comparison to &lt;i&gt;Twisselmann&lt;/i&gt; hot extraction, results presented here show an increased efficiency of MSE by +25% for bovine liver, +14% for chicken eggs, +13% for poultry meat, +12% for fish, 8% for bovine meat, and 6% for infant food. For the first time, a fast and reliable routine method is available that enables the analyst to reproducibly extract \"total\" lipids from any EU-regulated food sample of animal origin within 6 to 8 minutes. Increased efficiency translates into a considerable increase in both lipid and wet weight-based analytical results measured for associated POPs, reducing the risk of false non-compliant results. Compared to a 4 hour &lt;i&gt;Twisselmann&lt;/i&gt; extraction, the extraction of 1000 samples using MSE would result in annual savings of about 250 hours or 32 working days. Our MSE procedure contributes to the European Commission's objective of harmonising analytical results across the EU generated according to Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/644.</td>\n",

The main source of human exposure to dioxins is food of animal origin, whereas feeds are the main route of exposure of farmed animals to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls. The aim of the study was to simulate dioxin passage from feed to tissues on farm animals using transfer models, and, in addition, to assess the risk to consumers of food of animal origin. From over 700 feed samples analyzed over the course of 9 years (2013-2021), those exceeding the maximum permissible levels set down in Commission Regulation No 277/2012/EU were selected. These samples being derived from real cases of dioxin contamination made it possible to present the most realistic picture of the effects these feed materials could have had if they had entered the food chain. Three species of animals were selected (laying hens, dairy cattle and slaughter pigs), for which feed materials with dioxin contents exceeding the maximum permissible level were selected in accordance with the nutritional recommendations. The calculated PCDD/PCDF concentrations in chicken eggs, cow's milk and pork were above the maximum permissible level in most cases., The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducted a survey of domestic animal products including beef fat, pork fat, chicken fat, turkey fat, dairy cow fat, and siluriform fish muscle (i.e. catfish) to determine the current residue levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and non-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-polychlorinated biphenyls (&lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;-PCBs).

The survey is conducted every 5 years. Fat samples for each slaughter class and siluriform fillets were collected from U.S. federally inspected slaughter facilities, processed, and analysed for 17 PCDD/Fs and 3 &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;-PCBs. Toxic equivalency concentrations were calculated using 2005 toxic equivalency factors and summed (sum-TEQ) for all slaughter classes. The sum-TEQs ranged from non-detect (nd) to 16.5 pg TEQ/g lipid. The median sum-TEQs, when nd = ½ LOD, for beef, pork, chicken, turkey, dairy cow, and siluriform fish were 0.48, 0.08, 0.07, 0.21, 0.38, and 0.62 pg TEQ/g lipid (wet weight for siluriform fish), respectively. A comparison of the current and previous surveys typically depicts a significant declining trend depending on the slaughter class (such as chicken and turkey), however, beef and pork fat median values slightly increased and decreased, respectively, but neither were significant compared to the previous survey.

       "      <td>Indiscriminate antimicrobial use (AMU) in animal production is a driver of antimicrobial resistance globally. There is a need to define sustainable interventions to reduce AMU in small-scale production systems, which currently represent the most widespread farming systems in South East Asia and many low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a before-and-after intervention study on a random sample of small-scale chicken farms in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam from 2016 to 2019. The study included a baseline followed by an intervention phase where farmers were provided with regular veterinary advice on flock health and husbandry, as well as antimicrobial replacement products. Of 102 recruited farms (raising &gt;100 chickens per flock cycle), thirty-five (34.2%) entered the intervention phase, whilst the rest stopped raising chickens, mainly due to suboptimal flock performance. Through the implementation of our intervention, chicken flocks reduced levels of AMU by 66% [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.34; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) from a baseline of 343.4 Animal Daily Doses per 1,000 chicken-days and decreased weekly mortality by 40% (adjusted HR = 0.60; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) from a baseline mortality of 1.60 per 100 birds. Chicken bodyweight increased by 100 g (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) in intervention flocks. Our findings demonstrate that the provision of veterinary advice can achieve substantial reductions in AMU in small-scale production systems without compromising flock health and productivity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Small-scale farming of meat chicken flocks using local native breeds contributes to the economy of many rural livelihoods in Vietnam and many other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These systems are also the target of high levels of antimicrobial use (AMU); however, little is known about the profitability and sustainability of such systems. Since small-scale farms are commercial enterprises, this knowledge is essential to develop successful strategies to curb excessive AMU. Using longitudinal data from 203 small-scale (100-2,000 heads) native chicken flocks raised in 102 randomly selected farms in Dong Thap province (Mekong Delta, Vietnam), we investigated the financial and economic parameters of such systems and the main constraints to their sustainability. Feed accounted for the largest financial cost (flock median 49.5 % [Inter-quartile range (IQR) 41.5-61.8 %]) of total costs, followed by day-old-chicks (DOCs) (median 30.3 % [IQR 23.2-38.4 %]), non-antimicrobial health-supporting products (median 7.1 % [IQR 4.7-10.5 %]), vaccines (median 3.1 % [IQR 2.2-4.8 %]), equipment (median 1.9 % [IQR 0.0-4.9 %]) and antimicrobials (median 1.9 % [IQR 0.7-3.6 %]). Excluding labor costs, farmers achieved a positive return on investment (ROI) from 120 (59.1 %) flocks, the remainder generating a loss (median ROI 124 % [IQR 36-206 %]). Higher ROI was associated with higher flock size and low mortality. There was no statistical association between use of medicated feed and flock mortality or chicken bodyweight. The median daily income per person dedicated to raising chickens was 202,100 VND, lower than alternative rural labor activities in the Mekong Delta. In a large proportion of farms (33.4 %), farmers decided to stop raising chickens after completing one cycle. Farmers who dropped off chicken production purchased more expensive feed (in 1000 VND per kg): 11.1 [10.6-11.5] vs. 10.8 [10.4-11.3] for farms that continued production (p = 0.039), and experienced higher chicken mortality (28.5 % [12.0-79.0 %] vs. 16 [7.5-33.0 %]; p = 0.004). The rapid turnover of farmers raising chickens in such systems represents a challenge to the uptake of messages on appropriate AMU and chicken health. To ensure sustainability of small-scale commercial systems, advisory services need to be available to farmers as they initiate new flocks, and support them in the early stages to help overcome their limited experience and skills. This targeted approach would support profitability whilst reducing risk of emergence of AMR and infectious disease from these systems., Antimicrobials are extensively used both prophylactically and therapeutically in poultry production. Despite this, there are little data on the effect of antimicrobial use (AMU) on disease incidence rate and per cent mortality. We investigated the relationships between AMU and disease and between AMU and mortality using data from a large (n = 322 flocks) cohort of small-scale chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, that were followed longitudinally from day old to slaughter (5,566 observation weeks). We developed a parameterized algorithm to emulate a randomized control trial from observational data by categorizing the observation weeks into 'non-AMU', 'prophylactic AMU' and 'therapeutic AMU'. To evaluate the prophylactic AMU effect, we compared the frequencies of clinical signs in 'non-AMU' and 'prophylactic AMU' periods. To analyse therapeutic AMU, we compared weekly per cent mortality between the weeks of disease episodes before and after AMU. Analyses were stratified by clinical signs (4) and antimicrobial classes (13). Prophylactic AMU never reduced the probability of disease, and some antimicrobial classes such as lincosamides, amphenicols and penicillins increased the risk. The risk of diarrhoea consistently increased with prophylactic AMU. Therapeutic AMU often had an effect on mortality, but the pattern was inconsistent across the combinations of antimicrobial classes and clinical signs with 14/29 decreasing and 11/29 increasing the per cent weekly mortality. Lincosamides, methenamines and cephalosporins were the only three antimicrobial classes that always decreased the mortality when used therapeutically. Results were robust respective to the parameters values of the weeks categorization algorithm. This information should help support policy efforts and interventions aiming at reducing AMU in animal production., Antimicrobials are extensively used both prophylactically and therapeutically in poultry production.

Although &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus salivarius&lt;/i&gt; has long been proposed to be a probiotic, the understanding of the roles of this species is still in its infancy. Here, a strain of &lt;i&gt;L. salivarius&lt;/i&gt; CGMCC20700 isolated from the intestinal mucosa of Yunnan black-bone chicken broilers was investigated in the context of its safety and probiotic characteristics by whole-genome sequencing in parallel with phenotypic analysis. Whole-genome sequencing results showed that &lt;i&gt;L. salivarius&lt;/i&gt; CGMCC20700 has a single scaffold of 1,737,577 bp with an average guanine-to-cytosine (GC) ratio of 33.51% and 1,757 protein-coding genes. The annotation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) classified the predicted proteins from the assembled genome as possessing cellular, metabolic, and information-related functions. Sequences related to risk assessment, such as antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, were identified, and the strain was further confirmed as safe according to the results of antibiotic resistance, hemolytic, and acute oral toxicology tests. Two gene clusters of antibacterial compounds and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity were identified using genome mining tools and antibacterial spectrum tests. Stress resistance genes, active stressor removal genes, and adhesion related genes that were identified and examined with various phenotypic assays (such as stress tolerance tests in acids and bile salts and auto aggregation and hydrophobicity assays). The strain showed a high survival rate in the presence of bile salts and under acidic conditions and exhibited significant auto aggregation capacity and hydrophobicity. Overall, &lt;i&gt;L. salivarius&lt;/i&gt; CGMCC20700 demonstrated excellent safety and probiotic potential at both the genomic and physiological levels and can be considered an appropriate candidate probiotic for livestock and poultry farming., We have previously demonstrated that human vaginal Lactobacillus crispatus 2029 (LC2029) strain is highly adhesive to cervicovaginal epithelial cells, exhibits antagonistic activity against genitourinary pathogens and expresses surface-layer protein (Slp). The aims of the present study were elucidation of Slp structural and immunomodulatory characteristics and its roles in protective properties of the whole vaginal LC2029 bacteria against foodborne pathogens. Enteric Caco-2 and colon HT-29 cell lines were used as the in vitro models of the human intestinal epithelial layer. LC2029 strain has two homologous surface-layer (S-layer) genes, slp1 and slp2. Whilst we found no evidence for the expression of slp1 under the growth conditions used, a very high level of expression of the slp2 gene was detected. C-terminal part of the amino sequence of Slp2 protein was found to be highly similar to that of the conserved C-terminal region of SlpA protein of L. crispatus Zj001 isolated from pig intestines and CbsA protein of L. crispatus JCM5810 isolated from chicken intestines, and was substantially variable at the N-terminal and middle regions. The amino acid sequence identity between SlpA and CbsA was as high as 84%, whilst the identity levels of these sequences with that of Slp2 were only 49% and 50% (respectively). LC2029 strain was found to be both acid and bile tolerant. Survival in simulated gastric and intestinal juices of LC2029 cells unable to produce Slp2 was reduced by 2-3 logs. Vaginal L. crispatus 1385 (LC1385) strain not expressing Slp was also very sensitive to gastric and intestinal stresses. Slp2 was found to be non-covalently bound to the surface of the bacterium, acting as an adhesin and facilitating interaction of LC2029 lactobacilli with the host immature or fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, as well as HT-29 cells. No toxicity to or damage of Caco-2 or HT-29 epithelial cells were detected after 24 h of colonization by LC2029 lactobacilli. Both Slp2 protein and LC2029 cells induced NF-kB activation in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, but did not induce expression of innate immunity mediators Il-8, Il-1β, and TNF-α. Slp2 and LC2029 inhibited Il-8 production in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells induced by MALP-2 and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-6. Slp2 inhibited production of CXCL1 and RANTES by Caco-2 cells during differentiation and maturation process within 15 days. Culturing Caco-2 and HT-29 cells in the presence of Slp2 increased adhesion of bifidobacteria BLI-2780 to these enterocytes. Upon binding to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, Slp2 protein and LC2029 lactobacilli were recognized by toll-like receptors (TLR) 2/6. It was shown that LC2029 strain is a strong co-aggregator of foodborne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H used in this study. The Slp2 was responsible for the ability of LC2029 to co-aggregate these enteropathogens. Slp2 and intact LC2029 lactobacilli inhibited foodborne pathogen-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 as apoptotic biomarkers in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. In addition, Slp2 and Slp2-positive LC2029 strain reduced adhesion of tested pathogenic bacteria to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Slp2-positive LC2029 strain but not Slp2 alone provided bactericidal effect on foodborne pathogens. These results suggest a range of mechanisms involved in inhibition of growth, viability, and cell-adhesion properties of pathogenic Proteobacteria by the Slp2 producing LC2029, which may be useful in treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in newborns and foodborne infectious diseases in children and adults, increasing the colonization resistance and maintaining the intestinal homeostasis., We have previously demonstrated that human vaginal Lactobacillus crispatus 2029 (LC2029) strain is highly adhesive to cervicovaginal epithelial cells, exhibits antagonistic activity against genitourinary pathogens and expresses surface-layer protein (Slp). The aims of the present study were elucidation of Slp structural and immunomodulatory characteristics and its roles in protective properties of the whole vaginal LC2029 bacteria against foodborne pathogens. Enteric Caco-2 and colon HT-29 cell lines were used as the in vitro models of the human intestinal epithelial layer. LC2029 strain has two homologous surface-layer (S-layer) genes, slp1 and slp2. Whilst we found no evidence for the expression of slp1 under the growth conditions used, a very high level of expression of the slp2 gene was detected. C-terminal part of the amino sequence of Slp2 protein was found to be highly similar to that of the conserved C-terminal region of SlpA protein of L. crispatus Zj001 isolated from pig intestines and CbsA protein of L. crispatus JCM5810 isolated from chicken intestines, and was substantially variable at the N-terminal and middle regions. The amino acid sequence identity between SlpA and CbsA was as high as 84%, whilst the identity levels of these sequences with that of Slp2 were only 49% and 50% (respectively). LC2029 strain was found to be both acid and bile tolerant. Survival in simulated gastric and intestinal juices of LC2029 cells unable to produce Slp2 was reduced by 2-3 logs. Vaginal L. crispatus 1385 (LC1385) strain not expressing Slp was also very sensitive to gastric and intestinal stresses. Slp2 was found to be non-covalently bound to the surface of the bacterium, acting as an adhesin and facilitating interaction of LC2029 lactobacilli with the host immature or fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, as well as HT-29 cells. No toxicity to or damage of Caco-2 or HT-29 epithelial cells were detected after 24 h of colonization by LC2029 lactobacilli. Both Slp2 protein and LC2029 cells induced NF-kB activation in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, but did not induce expression of innate immunity mediators Il-8, Il-1β, and TNF-α. Slp2 and LC2029 inhibited Il-8 production in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells induced by MALP-2 and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-6. Slp2 inhibited production of CXCL1 and RANTES by Caco-2 cells during differentiation and maturation process within 15 days. Culturing Caco-2 and HT-29 cells in the presence of Slp2 increased adhesion of bifidobacteria BLI-2780 to these enterocytes. Upon binding to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, Slp2 protein and LC2029 lactobacilli were recognized by toll-like receptors (TLR) 2/6. It was shown that LC2029 strain is a strong co-aggregator of foodborne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H used in this study. The Slp2 was responsible for the ability of LC2029 to co-aggregate these enteropathogens. Slp2 and intact LC2029 lactobacilli inhibited foodborne pathogen-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 as apoptotic biomarkers in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. In addition, Slp2 and Slp2-positive LC2029 strain reduced adhesion of tested pathogenic bacteria to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Slp2-positive LC2029 strain but not Slp2 alone provided bactericidal effect on foodborne pathogens. These results suggest a range of mechanisms involved in inhibition of growth, viability, and cell-adhesion properties of pathogenic Proteobacteria by the Slp2 producing LC2029, which may be useful in treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in newborns and foodborne infectious diseases in children and adults, increasing the colonization resistance and maintaining the intestinal homeostasis.]</td>\n",

       "0  Globally, chicken is known to be a reservoir for the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes to humans. In Nigeria, antimicrobial drugs are readily accessible for use in poultry production, either for preventive or therapeutic purposes. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ESBL-EC) are transmissible to humans because of their zoonotic potentials. People working very closely with chickens either on farms or markets are at greater risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and zoonotic transmission of ESBL-EC among poultry-workers, chickens, and poultry environments in Abuja, Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers, chickens and poultry environment in selected farms/chicken markets in Abuja. Stool, faecal, and environmental samples were collected from apparently healthy workers, chickens, and farm/market environments from December 2018 to April 2019. Data were collected electronically using an open data kit (ODK) installed on a Smartphone. Antimicrobial resistance was determined using broth micro-dilution methods against a panel of 14 antimicrobial agents. We carried out the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the isolates. Data were analyzed by computing frequencies, proportions and spearman's correlation (ρ). Of 429 samples, 26.8% (<i>n</i> = 115) were positive for <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i>. Of the 115 <i>E. coli</i> isolates, 32.2% (<i>n</i> = 37) were confirmed ESBL producers by phenotypic characterization. Prevalence of ESBL-EC was highest among both poultry-workers (37.8%; <i>n</i> = 14) and chickens (37.8%; n = 14) followed by the environment (24.3%; <i>n</i> = 9). Both human and chicken isolates showed similar patterns of multidrug resistance to tested antimicrobials with a positive correlation (ρ = 0.91). Among ESBL producers, we observed the dissemination of <i>bla</i>CTX-M (10.8%; <i>n</i> = 4) genes. The coexistence of <i>bla</i>CTX-M-15 and <i>bla</i>TEM-1 genes was observed in 8.1% (<i>n</i> = 3) of the isolates, out of which (66.7%; <i>n</i> = 2) were chicken isolates from the farm, while a single human isolate was from the chicken market. ESBL-EC isolates were prevalent amongst apparently healthy individuals, chickens and the poultry farm/market environment in Abuja. It is important to educate healthcare workers that people in proximity with poultry are a high-risk group for faecal carriage of ESBL-EC, hence pose a higher risk to the general population for the spread of antimicrobial resistance.   \n",
       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Childhood stunting and malnutrition condemn millions of people globally to a life of disadvantage and cognitive and physical impairment. Though increasing egg consumption is often seen as an important solution for low and middle income countries (including Ethiopia), emerging evidence suggests that greater exposure to poultry feces may also inhibit child growth due to the effects of enteric bacteria, especially <i>Campylobacter</i>, on gut health. In this rapid ethnographic study, we explored village poultry production, child dietary practices, and environmental hygiene conditions as they relate to <i>Campylobacter</i> risk and intervention in 16 villages in Haramaya Woreda, Eastern Ethiopia. In the study area, we found that women assumed primary responsibility to care for both chickens and children: in feeding, housing, and healthcare. Most chickens were free-range local indigenous breeds, and flock sizes were small and unstable due to epidemics, seasonal trends, reproductive patterns, and lack of food. Generally, eggs were seen as \"too luxurious\" to be eaten, and were predominantly sold at local markets for scarce cash, despite high malnutrition rates. Local narratives of extreme poverty, social dietary norms, parental fatalism, and lack of \"dietary consciousness\" (as it was called) were invoked to explain this. We found that homesteads were highly contaminated with human and animal feces. Although community members viewed chicken feces and poultry gastrointestinal contents as particularly noxious in comparison to other animals because of their feeding behaviour, they did not relate them to any particular disease. Shared human-animal housing and childcare practices place children at high risk of exposure to enteric bacteria from animal manure, despite daily routines designed to manage the domestic landscape. Addressing childhood stunting and malnutrition through egg production in rural landscapes like Haramaya must navigate three distinct health and care regimes: for children, chickens, and home environments. Interventions should be based on a holistic approach to social and economic empowerment, one that considers both women and men and integrates nutrition, health, and community change as its overarching goal.   \n",

Foods of animal origin are therefore the main contributors to human dietary exposure. The European Union's (EU) food safety policy requires checking of a wide range of samples for compliance with legal limits on a regular basis. Several methods of varying efficiency are applied by official control laboratories for extraction of the different classes of lipids and associated POPs, bound to animal tissue and animal products in varying degrees, sometimes leading to discrepancies especially in fresh weight based analytical results. Starting from <i>Smedes'</i> lipid extraction from marine tissue, we optimized the extraction efficiency for both lipids and lipophilic pollutants, abandoning the time-consuming centrifugation step. The resulting modified <i>Smedes</i> extraction (MSE) method was validated based on multiple analyses of a large number of real world samples, matrix calibration and performance assessment in proficiency testing utilizing both instrumental and bioanalytical methodologies. Intermediate precision in 12 different foods was below 3% in chicken eggs, egg powder, animal fat, fish, fish oil, poultry, whole milk, milk fat and milk powder, and below 5% in bovine meat, liver, and infant food. In comparison to <i>Twisselmann</i> hot extraction, results presented here show an increased efficiency of MSE by +25% for bovine liver, +14% for chicken eggs, +13% for poultry meat, +12% for fish, 8% for bovine meat, and 6% for infant food. For the first time, a fast and reliable routine method is available that enables the analyst to reproducibly extract \"total\" lipids from any EU-regulated food sample of animal origin within 6 to 8 minutes. Increased efficiency translates into a considerable increase in both lipid and wet weight-based analytical results measured for associated POPs, reducing the risk of false non-compliant results. Compared to a 4 hour <i>Twisselmann</i> extraction, the extraction of 1000 samples using MSE would result in annual savings of about 250 hours or 32 working days. Our MSE procedure contributes to the European Commission's objective of harmonising analytical results across the EU generated according to Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/644.   \n",

There is a need to define sustainable interventions to reduce AMU in small-scale production systems, which currently represent the most widespread farming systems in South East Asia and many low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a before-and-after intervention study on a random sample of small-scale chicken farms in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam from 2016 to 2019. The study included a baseline followed by an intervention phase where farmers were provided with regular veterinary advice on flock health and husbandry, as well as antimicrobial replacement products. Of 102 recruited farms (raising >100 chickens per flock cycle), thirty-five (34.2%) entered the intervention phase, whilst the rest stopped raising chickens, mainly due to suboptimal flock performance. Through the implementation of our intervention, chicken flocks reduced levels of AMU by 66% [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.34; <i>p</i> = 0.002) from a baseline of 343.4 Animal Daily Doses per 1,000 chicken-days and decreased weekly mortality by 40% (adjusted HR = 0.60; <i>p</i> = 0.005) from a baseline mortality of 1.60 per 100 birds. Chicken bodyweight increased by 100 g (<i>p</i> = 0.002) in intervention flocks. Our findings demonstrate that the provision of veterinary advice can achieve substantial reductions in AMU in small-scale production systems without compromising flock health and productivity.   \n",

In this study, we analyzed 105 <i>L. crispatus</i> genomes isolated from a variety of ecological niches, including the human vaginal tract, human gut, chicken gut and turkey gut, to shed light on the genetic and functional features that drive evolution and adaptation of this important species. We performed <i>in silico</i> analyses to identify the pan and core genomes of <i>L. crispatus</i>, and to reveal the genomic differences and similarities associated with their origins of isolation. Our results demonstrated that, although a significant portion of the genomic content is conserved, human and poultry <i>L. crispatus</i> isolates evolved to encompass different genomic features (e.g. carbohydrate usage, CRISPR-Cas immune systems, prophage occurrence) in order to thrive in different environmental niches. We also observed that chicken and turkey <i>L. crispatus</i> isolates can be differentiated based on their genomic information, suggesting significant differences may exist between these two poultry gut niches. These results provide insights into host and niche-specific adaptation patterns in species of human and animal importance.   \n",

Nonetheless, the ESBL-E. coli transmission relationship among clinical sites and chicken farms remains unclear. Here, 408 ESBL-E. coli strains were isolated from hospitals and chicken farms in Sichuan Province and Yunnan Province in 2021. We detected <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M</sub> genes in 337 (82.62%) ESBL-E. coli strains. Although the isolation rate, prevalent sequence type (ST) subtypes, and <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M</sub> gene subtypes of ESBL-E. coli varied based on regions and sources, a few strains of CTX-ESBL-E. coli derived from clinical sites and chicken farms in Sichuan Province displayed high genetic similarity. This indicates a risk of ESBL-E. coli transmission from chickens to humans. Moreover, we found that the high-risk clonal strains ST131 and ST1193 primarily carried <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-27</sub>. This indicates that drug-resistant E. coli from animal and human sources should be monitored. As well, the overuse of β-lactam antibiotics should be avoided in poultry farms to ensure public health and build an effective regulatory mechanism of \"farm to fork\" under a One Health perspective. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacterial drug resistance has become one of the most significant threats to human health worldwide, especially for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli). Timely and accurate epidemiological surveys can provide scientific guidance for the adoption of treatments in different regions and also reduce the formation of drug-resistant bacteria. Our study showed that the subtypes of ESBL-E. coli strains prevalent in different provinces are somewhat different, so it is necessary to individualize treatment regimens in different regions, and it is especially important to limit and reduce antibiotic use in poultry farming since chicken-derived ESBL-E. coli serves as an important reservoir of drug resistance genes and has the potential to spread to humans, thus posing a threat to human health. The use of antibiotics in poultry farming should be particularly limited and reduced., Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an emerging pathogen of high concern given its resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Broiler chicken, which is the number one consumed meat in the United States and worldwide, can be a reservoir of ESBL E. coli. Backyard poultry ownership is on the rise in the United States, yet there is little research investigating prevalence of ESBL E. coli in this setting. This study aims to identify the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles (phenotypically and genotypically) of ESBL E. coli in some backyard and commercial broiler farms in the U.S. For this study ten backyard and ten commercial farms were visited at three time-points across flock production. Fecal (n = 10), litter/compost (n = 5), soil (n = 5), and swabs of feeders and waterers (n = 6) were collected at each visit and processed for E. coli. Assessment of ESBL phenotype was determined through using disk diffusion with 3rd generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and that with clavulanic acid. Broth microdilution and whole genome sequencing were used to investigate both phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles, respectively. ESBL E. coli was more prevalent in backyard farms with 12.95% of samples testing positive whereas 0.77% of commercial farm samples were positive. All isolates contained a blaCTX-M gene, the dominant variant being blaCTX-M-1, and its presence was entirely due to plasmids. Our study confirms concerns of growing resistance to fourth generation cephalosporin, cefepime, as roughly half (51.4%) of all isolates were found to be susceptible dose-dependent and few were resistant. Resistance to non-beta lactams, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, was also detected in our samples. Our study identifies prevalence of blaCTX-M type ESBL E. coli in U.S. backyard broiler farms, emphasizing the need for interventions for food and production safety., Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an emerging pathogen of high concern given its resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Broiler chicken, which is the number one consumed meat in the United States and worldwide, can be a reservoir of ESBL E. coli.

Though increasing egg consumption is often seen as an important solution for low and middle income countries (including Ethiopia), emerging evidence suggests that greater exposure to poultry feces may also inhibit child growth due to the effects of enteric bacteria, especially <i>Campylobacter</i>, on gut health. In this rapid ethnographic study, we explored village poultry production, child dietary practices, and environmental hygiene conditions as they relate to <i>Campylobacter</i> risk and intervention in 16 villages in Haramaya Woreda, Eastern Ethiopia. In the study area, we found that women assumed primary responsibility to care for both chickens and children: in feeding, housing, and healthcare. Most chickens were free-range local indigenous breeds, and flock sizes were small and unstable due to epidemics, seasonal trends, reproductive patterns, and lack of food. Generally, eggs were seen as \"too luxurious\" to be eaten, and were predominantly sold at local markets for scarce cash, despite high malnutrition rates. Local narratives of extreme poverty, social dietary norms, parental fatalism, and lack of \"dietary consciousness\" (as it was called) were invoked to explain this. We found that homesteads were highly contaminated with human and animal feces. Although community members viewed chicken feces and poultry gastrointestinal contents as particularly noxious in comparison to other animals because of their feeding behaviour, they did not relate them to any particular disease. Shared human-animal housing and childcare practices place children at high risk of exposure to enteric bacteria from animal manure, despite daily routines designed to manage the domestic landscape. Addressing childhood stunting and malnutrition through egg production in rural landscapes like Haramaya must navigate three distinct health and care regimes: for children, chickens, and home environments. Interventions should be based on a holistic approach to social and economic empowerment, one that considers both women and men and integrates nutrition, health, and community change as its overarching goal., According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre report on global human displacement, Ethiopia has the highest number of newly displaced people forced to flee their homes. Displaced people have arrived in other regions, sometimes leading to conflict. Several regions in Ethiopia experience on-going ethnic tensions and violence between tribes, which leaves smallholder farmers suspicious of any outside activities in their locale, assuming other ethnic groups may harm them. Changes in the central Ethiopian government have also led to suspicion of non-local agencies. The <i>Campylobacter</i> Genomics and Enteric Dysfunction (CAGED) research project's objective is to improve the incomes, livelihoods and nutrition of smallholder farmers and was conducted during this period of increasing violence. The project aims to assess the impact of reducing exposure to chicken excreta on young children's gut health and growth. This paper does not report empirical findings from CAGED, but is part of a series that aims to identify challenges in humanitarian research and reports on mitigation strategies during this research. This research is important to determine whether <i>Campylobacter</i> infection in chicken's contributes to illness and stunting in children. However, violence against other researchers in different parts of Ethiopia led to mistrust and lack of engagement by the community with the researchers. Some reactions were so hostile that the team was fearful about returning to some households. As a result, the team designed strategies to respond, including establishing two types of community advisory boards. One used pre-existing village elder structures and another was composed of village youth. Data collection team members received training in principles of ethics, consent, and crisis management, and were provided on-going support from local and international principal investigators and the study's ethics advisor. The hostility and mistrust led to fear among the data collectors. These and the resulting strategies to address them resulted in delays for the research. However, the interventions taken resulted in successful completion of the field activities. Moreover, the lessons learned from this project are already being implemented with other projects being conducted in various parts of Ethiopia., According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre report on global human displacement, Ethiopia has the highest number of newly displaced people forced to flee their homes.

The main source of human exposure to dioxins is food of animal origin, whereas feeds are the main route of exposure of farmed animals to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls. The aim of the study was to simulate dioxin passage from feed to tissues on farm animals using transfer models, and, in addition, to assess the risk to consumers of food of animal origin. From over 700 feed samples analyzed over the course of 9 years (2013-2021), those exceeding the maximum permissible levels set down in Commission Regulation No 277/2012/EU were selected. These samples being derived from real cases of dioxin contamination made it possible to present the most realistic picture of the effects these feed materials could have had if they had entered the food chain. Three species of animals were selected (laying hens, dairy cattle and slaughter pigs), for which feed materials with dioxin contents exceeding the maximum permissible level were selected in accordance with the nutritional recommendations. The calculated PCDD/PCDF concentrations in chicken eggs, cow's milk and pork were above the maximum permissible level in most cases., The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducted a survey of domestic animal products including beef fat, pork fat, chicken fat, turkey fat, dairy cow fat, and siluriform fish muscle (i.e. catfish) to determine the current residue levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and non-<i>ortho</i>-polychlorinated biphenyls (<i>no</i>-PCBs). The following types of fat samples were analysed: beef from heifers and steers (referred to as \"beef\"), pork, chicken, turkey, dairy cow (referred to as \"dairy cow\"), and siluriform fish muscle, which includes catfish. The survey is conducted every 5 years. Fat samples for each slaughter class and siluriform fillets were collected from U.S. federally inspected slaughter facilities, processed, and analysed for 17 PCDD/Fs and 3 <i>no</i>-PCBs. Toxic equivalency concentrations were calculated using 2005 toxic equivalency factors and summed (sum-TEQ) for all slaughter classes. The sum-TEQs ranged from non-detect (nd) to 16.5 pg TEQ/g lipid. The median sum-TEQs, when nd = ½ LOD, for beef, pork, chicken, turkey, dairy cow, and siluriform fish were 0.48, 0.08, 0.07, 0.21, 0.38, and 0.62 pg TEQ/g lipid (wet weight for siluriform fish), respectively. A comparison of the current and previous surveys typically depicts a significant declining trend depending on the slaughter class (such as chicken and turkey), however, beef and pork fat median values slightly increased and decreased, respectively, but neither were significant compared to the previous survey. The congener patterns for some high concentration beef and pork fat samples suggested that pentachlorophenol treated wood continues to be a likely on-farm dioxin exposure source., The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducted a survey of domestic animal products including beef fat, pork fat, chicken fat, turkey fat, dairy cow fat, and siluriform fish muscle (i.e. catfish) to determine the current residue levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and non-<i>ortho</i>-polychlorinated biphenyls (<i>no</i>-PCBs).

These systems are also the target of high levels of antimicrobial use (AMU); however, little is known about the profitability and sustainability of such systems. Since small-scale farms are commercial enterprises, this knowledge is essential to develop successful strategies to curb excessive AMU. Using longitudinal data from 203 small-scale (100-2,000 heads) native chicken flocks raised in 102 randomly selected farms in Dong Thap province (Mekong Delta, Vietnam), we investigated the financial and economic parameters of such systems and the main constraints to their sustainability. Feed accounted for the largest financial cost (flock median 49.5 % [Inter-quartile range (IQR) 41.5-61.8 %]) of total costs, followed by day-old-chicks (DOCs) (median 30.3 % [IQR 23.2-38.4 %]), non-antimicrobial health-supporting products (median 7.1 % [IQR 4.7-10.5 %]), vaccines (median 3.1 % [IQR 2.2-4.8 %]), equipment (median 1.9 % [IQR 0.0-4.9 %]) and antimicrobials (median 1.9 % [IQR 0.7-3.6 %]). Excluding labor costs, farmers achieved a positive return on investment (ROI) from 120 (59.1 %) flocks, the remainder generating a loss (median ROI 124 % [IQR 36-206 %]). Higher ROI was associated with higher flock size and low mortality. There was no statistical association between use of medicated feed and flock mortality or chicken bodyweight. The median daily income per person dedicated to raising chickens was 202,100 VND, lower than alternative rural labor activities in the Mekong Delta. In a large proportion of farms (33.4 %), farmers decided to stop raising chickens after completing one cycle. Farmers who dropped off chicken production purchased more expensive feed (in 1000 VND per kg): 11.1 [10.6-11.5] vs. 10.8 [10.4-11.3] for farms that continued production (p = 0.039), and experienced higher chicken mortality (28.5 % [12.0-79.0 %] vs. 16 [7.5-33.0 %]; p = 0.004). The rapid turnover of farmers raising chickens in such systems represents a challenge to the uptake of messages on appropriate AMU and chicken health. To ensure sustainability of small-scale commercial systems, advisory services need to be available to farmers as they initiate new flocks, and support them in the early stages to help overcome their limited experience and skills. This targeted approach would support profitability whilst reducing risk of emergence of AMR and infectious disease from these systems., Antimicrobials are extensively used both prophylactically and therapeutically in poultry production. Despite this, there are little data on the effect of antimicrobial use (AMU) on disease incidence rate and per cent mortality. We investigated the relationships between AMU and disease and between AMU and mortality using data from a large (n = 322 flocks) cohort of small-scale chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, that were followed longitudinally from day old to slaughter (5,566 observation weeks). We developed a parameterized algorithm to emulate a randomized control trial from observational data by categorizing the observation weeks into 'non-AMU', 'prophylactic AMU' and 'therapeutic AMU'. To evaluate the prophylactic AMU effect, we compared the frequencies of clinical signs in 'non-AMU' and 'prophylactic AMU' periods. To analyse therapeutic AMU, we compared weekly per cent mortality between the weeks of disease episodes before and after AMU. Analyses were stratified by clinical signs (4) and antimicrobial classes (13). Prophylactic AMU never reduced the probability of disease, and some antimicrobial classes such as lincosamides, amphenicols and penicillins increased the risk. The risk of diarrhoea consistently increased with prophylactic AMU. Therapeutic AMU often had an effect on mortality, but the pattern was inconsistent across the combinations of antimicrobial classes and clinical signs with 14/29 decreasing and 11/29 increasing the per cent weekly mortality. Lincosamides, methenamines and cephalosporins were the only three antimicrobial classes that always decreased the mortality when used therapeutically. Results were robust respective to the parameters values of the weeks categorization algorithm. This information should help support policy efforts and interventions aiming at reducing AMU in animal production., Antimicrobials are extensively used both prophylactically and therapeutically in poultry production.

       "5  [Lactic acid bacteria are generally regarded as alternatives to antibiotics in livestock and poultry farming, especially <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains, which are safe and have probiotic potential. Although <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> has long been proposed to be a probiotic, the understanding of the roles of this species is still in its infancy. Here, a strain of <i>L. salivarius</i> CGMCC20700 isolated from the intestinal mucosa of Yunnan black-bone chicken broilers was investigated in the context of its safety and probiotic characteristics by whole-genome sequencing in parallel with phenotypic analysis. Whole-genome sequencing results showed that <i>L. salivarius</i> CGMCC20700 has a single scaffold of 1,737,577 bp with an average guanine-to-cytosine (GC) ratio of 33.51% and 1,757 protein-coding genes. The annotation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) classified the predicted proteins from the assembled genome as possessing cellular, metabolic, and information-related functions. Sequences related to risk assessment, such as antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, were identified, and the strain was further confirmed as safe according to the results of antibiotic resistance, hemolytic, and acute oral toxicology tests. Two gene clusters of antibacterial compounds and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity were identified using genome mining tools and antibacterial spectrum tests. Stress resistance genes, active stressor removal genes, and adhesion related genes that were identified and examined with various phenotypic assays (such as stress tolerance tests in acids and bile salts and auto aggregation and hydrophobicity assays). The strain showed a high survival rate in the presence of bile salts and under acidic conditions and exhibited significant auto aggregation capacity and hydrophobicity. Overall, <i>L. salivarius</i> CGMCC20700 demonstrated excellent safety and probiotic potential at both the genomic and physiological levels and can be considered an appropriate candidate probiotic for livestock and poultry farming., We have previously demonstrated that human vaginal Lactobacillus crispatus 2029 (LC2029) strain is highly adhesive to cervicovaginal epithelial cells, exhibits antagonistic activity against genitourinary pathogens and expresses surface-layer protein (Slp). The aims of the present study were elucidation of Slp structural and immunomodulatory characteristics and its roles in protective properties of the whole vaginal LC2029 bacteria against foodborne pathogens. Enteric Caco-2 and colon HT-29 cell lines were used as the in vitro models of the human intestinal epithelial layer. LC2029 strain has two homologous surface-layer (S-layer) genes, slp1 and slp2. Whilst we found no evidence for the expression of slp1 under the growth conditions used, a very high level of expression of the slp2 gene was detected. C-terminal part of the amino sequence of Slp2 protein was found to be highly similar to that of the conserved C-terminal region of SlpA protein of L. crispatus Zj001 isolated from pig intestines and CbsA protein of L. crispatus JCM5810 isolated from chicken intestines, and was substantially variable at the N-terminal and middle regions. The amino acid sequence identity between SlpA and CbsA was as high as 84%, whilst the identity levels of these sequences with that of Slp2 were only 49% and 50% (respectively). LC2029 strain was found to be both acid and bile tolerant. Survival in simulated gastric and intestinal juices of LC2029 cells unable to produce Slp2 was reduced by 2-3 logs. Vaginal L. crispatus 1385 (LC1385) strain not expressing Slp was also very sensitive to gastric and intestinal stresses. Slp2 was found to be non-covalently bound to the surface of the bacterium, acting as an adhesin and facilitating interaction of LC2029 lactobacilli with the host immature or fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, as well as HT-29 cells. No toxicity to or damage of Caco-2 or HT-29 epithelial cells were detected after 24 h of colonization by LC2029 lactobacilli. Both Slp2 protein and LC2029 cells induced NF-kB activation in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, but did not induce expression of innate immunity mediators Il-8, Il-1β, and TNF-α. Slp2 and LC2029 inhibited Il-8 production in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells induced by MALP-2 and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-6. Slp2 inhibited production of CXCL1 and RANTES by Caco-2 cells during differentiation and maturation process within 15 days. Culturing Caco-2 and HT-29 cells in the presence of Slp2 increased adhesion of bifidobacteria BLI-2780 to these enterocytes. Upon binding to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, Slp2 protein and LC2029 lactobacilli were recognized by toll-like receptors (TLR) 2/6. It was shown that LC2029 strain is a strong co-aggregator of foodborne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H used in this study. The Slp2 was responsible for the ability of LC2029 to co-aggregate these enteropathogens. Slp2 and intact LC2029 lactobacilli inhibited foodborne pathogen-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 as apoptotic biomarkers in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. In addition, Slp2 and Slp2-positive LC2029 strain reduced adhesion of tested pathogenic bacteria to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Slp2-positive LC2029 strain but not Slp2 alone provided bactericidal effect on foodborne pathogens. These results suggest a range of mechanisms involved in inhibition of growth, viability, and cell-adhesion properties of pathogenic Proteobacteria by the Slp2 producing LC2029, which may be useful in treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in newborns and foodborne infectious diseases in children and adults, increasing the colonization resistance and maintaining the intestinal homeostasis., We have previously demonstrated that human vaginal Lactobacillus crispatus 2029 (LC2029) strain is highly adhesive to cervicovaginal epithelial cells, exhibits antagonistic activity against genitourinary pathogens and expresses surface-layer protein (Slp).

However, poultry also threatens human hygiene, especially as a fomite of infectious diseases caused by the major foodborne pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Listeria). Preventing pathogenic bacterial biofilm is crucial in the chicken industry due to increasing food safety hazards caused by recurring contamination and the rapid degradation of meat, as well as the increased resistance of bacteria to cleaning and disinfection procedures commonly used in chicken processing plants. To address this, various innovative and promising strategies to combat bacterial resistance and biofilm are emerging to improve food safety and quality and extend shelf-life. In particular, natural compounds are attractive because of their potential antimicrobial activities. Natural compounds can also boost the immune system and improve poultry health and performance. In addition to phytochemicals, bacteriophages, nanoparticles, coatings, enzymes, and probiotics represent unique and environmentally friendly strategies in the poultry processing industry to prevent foodborne pathogens from reaching the consumer. Lactoferrin, bacteriocin, antimicrobial peptides, cell-free supernatants, and biosurfactants are also of considerable interest for their prospective application as natural antimicrobials for improving the safety of raw poultry meat. This review aims to describe the feasibility of these proposed strategies and provide an overview of recent published evidences to control microorganisms in the poultry industry, considering the human health, food safety, and economic aspects of poultry production., Food borne diseases are one of the major human disease conditions worldwide. Most of them are of bacterial origin and chickens are a major source of such bacteria; they are consumed at high rate worldwide and tend to harbor the zoonotic bacteria without showing signs of illness. Running rain water tends to increase environmental contamination, since it carries various substances from one area to another; this results in village-indigenous chickens picking more bacteria from the environment as they roam/scavenge around for food. Thus, after the rain, the chickens' intestinal contents may contain more bacteria quantity-wise and type-wise. This study was carried-out to determine whether that was the case after heavy rains of 2018.120 intestine samples were collected from indigenous chickens from three slaughterhouses in Nairobi for bacterial quantification using the Miles and Misra technique; bacterial isolation and identification were carried out using standard bacteriological procedures. Intestines from the slaughterhouses had different mean bacterial counts: Kangemi had the highest (1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; colony-forming units per ml), followed by Burma (5.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;), then Kariokor (4.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most isolated at 85.8%, followed by genera &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; (55%), &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (43.3%), &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; (41.66%), &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; (38.3%), &lt;i&gt;Proteus&lt;/i&gt; (24.16%), &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella&lt;/i&gt; (7.5%), &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; (2.5%), &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; (6%), and &lt;i&gt;Streptobacillus&lt;/i&gt; (0.83%). The study showed that the indigenous chickens carry a variety of bacteria in types and numbers, some of them being zoonotic. Apart from picking more bacteria as a result of environmental contamination during rainy season, the weather and bird-handling further stress the birds, thus contributing to higher bacterial multiplication and higher bacterial carriage. If slaughter is not done right, these intestinal bacteria can easily cause contamination of respective chicken meat; thus, if pathogenic, it can cause food poisoning to consumers of the meat. Therefore, it is recommended that precaution be taken while slaughtering chickens for consumption. In addition, where possible, free-range indigenous chickens be confined during rainy seasons to reduce their exposure to contaminated environment., Salmonellosis, caused by &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; species, is one of the most common foodborne illnesses worldwide with an estimated 93.8 million cases and about 155,00 fatalities. In both industrialized and developing nations, Salmonellosis has been reported to be one of the most prevalent foodborne zoonoses and is linked with arrays of illness syndromes such as acute and chronic enteritis, and septicaemia. The two major and most common &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; species implicated in both warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals are &lt;i&gt;Salmonella bongori&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica.&lt;/i&gt; To date, more than 2400 &lt;i&gt;S. enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovars which affect both humans and animals have been identified. &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; is further classified into serotypes based on three primary antigenic determinants: somatic (O), flagella (H), and capsular (K). The capacity of nearly all &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; species to infect, multiply, and survive in human host cells with the aid of their pathogenic and virulence arsenals makes them deadly and important public health pathogens. Primarily, food-producing animals such as poultry, swine, cattle, and their products have been identified as important sources of salmonellosis. Additionally, raw fruits and vegetables are among other food types that have been linked to the spread of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. Based on the clinical manifestation of human salmonellosis, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; strains can be categorized as either non-typhoidal &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; (NTS) and typhoidal &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;. The detection of aseptically collected &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; in necropsies, environmental samples, feedstuffs, rectal swabs, and food products serves as the basis for diagnosis. In developing nations, typhoid fever due to &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; Typhi typically results in the death of 5%-30% of those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) calculated that there are between 16 and 17 million typhoid cases worldwide each year, with scaring 600,000 deaths as a result. The contagiousness of a &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; outbreak depends on the bacterial strain, serovar, growth environment, and host susceptibility. Risk factors for &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; infection include a variety of foods; for example, contaminated chicken, beef, and pork. Globally, there is a growing incidence and emergence of life-threatening clinical cases, especially due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; spp, including strains exhibiting resistance to important antimicrobials such as beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins. In extreme cases, especially in situations involving very difficult-to-treat strains, death usually results. The severity of the infections resulting from &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; pathogens is dependent on the serovar type, host susceptibility, the type of bacterial strains, and growth environment. This review therefore aims to detail the nomenclature, etiology, history, pathogenesis, reservoir, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, risk factors, antimicrobial resistance, public health importance, economic impact, treatment, and control of salmonellosis.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Campylobacter is one of the most commonly reported foodborne pathogens in the United States. Because poultry is considered a major source of Campylobacter infections in humans, reduction of Campylobacter contamination in poultry products is likely the most important and effective public health strategy for reducing the burden of campylobacteriosis in humans. A comprehensive on-line survey was conducted of key stakeholders in the U.S. broiler industry, including broiler farm managers (n = 18), poultry veterinarians (n = 18), and processing plant managers (n = 20), to assess the current pre- and postharvest Campylobacter interventions and control measures practiced by the industry for reducing Campylobacter contamination of broiler products. The survey also included information regarding each respondent's understanding of Campylobacter transmission and ecology in relation to broiler production. The results revealed that a majority of the establishments included in the survey are following the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service guidelines for controlling Campylobacter contamination in broiler flocks and on carcasses. However, establishments appeared to be putting more effort into Salmonella control than into Campylobacter control both on the farm and in the processing plant. A majority of the respondents responded that current interventions are not effective for reducing Campylobacter contamination, especially on the farm. Many respondents did not understand the risk factors associated with Campylobacter colonization in broiler flocks and on carcasses. Continued educational and training programs for key stakeholders in the U.S. broiler industry are needed to increase awareness of the issues associated with Campylobacter infection in broiler chickens and of the fact that Campylobacter infection is a multifaceted problem that requires efforts from both the pre- and postharvest sectors., &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; is a major foodborne pathogen and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been described worldwide. The main objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and AMR of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from broilers throughout the supply chain in Valencia, Spain. A total of 483 samples were included in the analysis: 430 from the slaughterhouse (chicken carcass and neck skin) and 53 from the point of sale (retail broiler and packaging). Taking into account the origin of the sample, the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. was 19% in carcass, 28.2% in neck skin, 36.7% in retail broiler, and 80% in packaging isolates. The prevalence of different species in the analyzed samples was 21.1% and 4.8% for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter coli&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. AMR profiling of 125 &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; isolates revealed that 122 (97.6%) of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; samples presented high resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, 96.1% and 90.2% respectively, whereas &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; showed 87% of resistance to both antimicrobials. Both species were resistant to tetracycline (&lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; 84.3% and &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; 60.9%) and 26.1% of &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; was resistant to streptomycin. These results showed no significant difference in the frequency of AMR (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≥ 0.05) among isolates originated from different points in the food-processing chain at slaughterhouses and retail establishments. In contrast, three main patterns were detected: quinolone-tetracycline (64%), quinolone-only (17.6%), and quinolone-tetracycline-aminoglycosides (8%). Additionally, 12.8% of the isolates presented multidrug resistance, with significantly higher levels detected among &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; (30.4%) isolates compared with &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; (8.8%) and all the three strains were resistant to all six antibiotics tested. Therefore, these results indicate that broilers could be a source of antimicrobial-resistant &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; in humans and consequently pose a risk to public health., &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; is the most frequent foodborne zoonotic bacteria worldwide, with chicken meat being overwhelmingly the most important reservoir for human infections. Control measures implemented at the farm level (i.e., biosecurity or vaccination), which have been successfully applied to limit other pathogens, such as &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;, have not been effective in reducing &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; occurrence. Thus, new approaches are needed to fully understand the ecological interactions of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; with host animals to effectively comprehend its epidemiology. The objective of this study was to analyse longitudinally the gut microbiota composition of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;-infected and non-infected farms to identify any difference that could potentially be indicative of gut colonization by &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. Differences in the colonization rate and timing were observed at the farms that became positive for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; over the investigated time points, even though in positive tests, the occurrence of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; gut colonization was not observed before the second week of the life of the birds. Significant differences were observed in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa between the microbiota of individuals belonging to farms that became &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; positive during the study and those who remained negative with particular reference to &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidales&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Clostridiales&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; colonization dramatically influenced the microbiota richness, although to a different extent depending on the infection timing. Finally, a key role of &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; genera on the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; microbial network was observed. Understanding the ecology of the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; interaction with host microbiota during infection could support novel approaches for broiler microbial barrier restoration. Therefore, evidence obtained through this study can be used to identify options to reduce the incidence of infection at a primary production level based on the targeted influence of the intestinal microbiota, thus helping develop new control strategies in order to mitigate the risk of human exposure to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; by chicken meat consumption.]</td>\n",

Multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates with high adaptability, have been responsible for many foodborne disease outbreaks. Here we present an investigation on the contamination and the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in retail meat obtained from supermarkets and from open markets in Guangxi, China. From the years 2009 to 2016, a total of 604 Salmonella isolates were recovered from a total of 3340 meat samples including 797 beef, 911 pork, 942 chicken and 690 duck, representing 18.08% of the samples tested. Pork was the most contaminated meat. Salmonella was detected in 322 samples from supermarkets and the positive rate of 21.03% was higher than that of 15.70% in 284 samples from open markets (P&lt;0.05). The prevalence of Salmonella in retail meat in the summer and fall months: June (2015, 40.63%), October (2012, 34.6%; 2016, 43.75%) was higher than in other seasons of the year. One hundred and twenty-seven serotypes were identified among the 604 Salmonella enterica isolates, and S. Derby (28.48%), S. Agona (9.77%), S. London (4.97%) and S. Enteritidis (4.47%) were the most common serotypes. Tests of susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents showed that 87.58% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and 57.79% exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR), as they were resistant to at least three antimicrobials. The presence of most of the antimicrobial-resistant genes tested was consistent with the resistant phenotypes found. Among all the antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs) examined in this study, bla&lt;sub&gt;TEM-1&lt;/sub&gt;, aadA1, cmlA, tetA, sul1 and sul2 were the most prevalent resistant genes in the multidrug resistant isolates. Our findings show that there was a trend that the Salmonella contamination in retail meat had increased and isolates showed an MDR phenotype and that the MDR had become more and more serious. Twenty-one isolates of S. Agona were randomly analyzed by using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) and six different types were found, indicating the existence of cross-contamination in the food market. The results indicate that the hazard analysis of the critical control points (HACCP) system for the whole food chain of retail meat should be further analyzed and improved., This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates. High levels of Salmonella contamination were detected in pork (67.0%), duck (50.5%) and chicken (46.2%). Thirty different serotypes were identified among 500 detected Salmonella isolates, as well as significant differences in serotypes between different retail meat samples. Notably, 405 (80.1%) isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). Meanwhile, we also found that 74 (14.8%) Salmonella isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the major mechanisms underlying this resistance were investigated. The commonest mutations in gyrA S83F (40.5%) and D87N (35.1%), and in parC was T57S (71.6%) and S80I (35.1%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that the S. Kentucky isolates that were resistant to ciprofloxacin mostly belonged to ST198 (21/23, 91.3%) and PFGE revealed the presence of various genotypes. This study identified a diversity of Salmonella serotypes and a high prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, which indicates that foodborne Salmonella potentially constitutes a potential food safety risk., This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates.

The focus of this study was the health risk assessment of consumers from the determination of ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TC), and oxytetracycline (OTC) in broiler chicken in the raw, frozen, and boiled stages using solid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and ultraviolet detection (SPE-HPLC-UV). Chromatographic separation was achieved using 0.3% metaphosphoric acid and acetonitrile (1:10, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) for CIP at 280 nm and oxalic acid (0.01 M) and acetonitrile (1:1, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) for TC and OTC at 355 nm with different retention times. The method had an acceptable precision with good linearity, specificity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, and stability. Among a total of 252 raw samples, approximately 68.25%, 25.4%, and 7.54% contained CIP, TC, and OTC, respectively. Out of the positive raw samples, CIP exceeded the maximum residual limit (MRL) in 3.6% muscle, 14.3% liver and 17.9% skin samples, whereas TC and OTC were below the MRLs. The residual concentrations of these antibiotics were almost unchanged in frozen samples. After boiling the chicken samples, the TC and OTC residues were reduced significantly compared to CIP. Although the concentrations of CIP in boiled samples were above the MRL set by the European Union, these did not exceed the hazard index 1. Based on these results, the exposure levels to antibiotics in broiler chicken meats may be considered to have a low risk for human health., In a market environment where food safety problems still occur despite repeated prohibitions, food safety problems caused by veterinary drug residues and biological safety problems caused by the transfer of drug resistance have attracted much attention. Herein, a method based on a compound purification system coupled with direct analysis in real time-tandem mass spectrometry (DART-MS/MS) was established to determine 41 different types of veterinary drug residues in livestock and poultry products. First, a single-standard solution sampling method was used to optimize the selection of the best quasi-molecular ion, two daughter ions, and their cone-hole and collision voltages; qualitative and quantitative ion pairs are composed of a quasi-molecular ion and its corresponding daughter ion. The abundance ratios of the drug compounds in standard solutions of the solvent and matrix mixtures were then calculated according to the requirements of the European Union 2002/657 specification. DART-MS/MS was subsequently developed for the accurate characterization and quantitative analysis of the veterinary drugs. Finally, a composite purification pretreatment system was formed by combining the primary secondary amine (PSA) and octadecyl bonded silica gel (C18) of a QuEChERS technology with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to achieve the one-step purification of the drug compounds. The influence of the key parameters of the DART ion source on the determination of the drugs was investigated using the peak areas of the quantitative ions as the criterion. The optimum conditions were as follows: ion source temperature of 350 ℃, 12-Dip-it Samplers module, sample injection speed of 0.6 mm/s, and external vacuum pump pressure of -75 kPa. According to the differences in the dissociation constant (p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) ranges of the 41 types of veterinary drug compounds and the characteristics of the sample matrixes, the extraction solvent, matrix-dispersing solvent, and purification method were optimized based on the recovery. The extraction solvent was 1.0% acetonitrile formate solution, and the pretreatment column included MWCNTs containing 50 mg of PSA and 50 mg of C18. The three chloramphenicol drugs showed a linear relationship in the ranges of 0.5-20 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9995-0.9997,and the detection and quantification limits of three chloramphenicol drugs were 0.1 and 0.5 μg/kg, respectively. The 38 other drugs, including quinolones, sulfonamides, and nitro-imidazoles showed a linear relationship in the ranges of 2-200 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9979-0.9999, and the detection and quantification limits of the 38 other drugs were 0.5 and 2.0 μg/kg, respectively. The recoveries of the 41 veterinary drugs at low, medium, and high spiked levels in chicken, pork, beef, and mutton samples were 80.0%-109.6%, with intra- and inter-day precisions of 0.3%-6.8% and 0.4%-7.0%, respectively. A total of 100 batches of animal meat (pork, chicken, beef, and mutton; 25 batches each) and known positive samples were simultaneously analyzed using the national standard method and the detection method established in this study. Sulfadiazine (89.2, 78.1, and 105.3 μg/kg) was detected in three batches of pork samples, and sarafloxacin (56.3, 102.0 μg/kg) was detected in two batches of chicken samples and no veterinary drugs were detected in the other samples; both methods yielded consistent results for known positive samples. The proposed method is rapid, simple, sensitive, environmentally friendly, and suitable for the simultaneous screening and detection of multiple veterinary drug residues in animal meat., The misuse of antibiotics in poultry farming is a global issue. The focus of this study was the health risk assessment of consumers from the determination of ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TC), and oxytetracycline (OTC) in broiler chicken in the raw, frozen, and boiled stages using solid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and ultraviolet detection (SPE-HPLC-UV). Chromatographic separation was achieved using 0.3% metaphosphoric acid and acetonitrile (1:10, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) for CIP at 280 nm and oxalic acid (0.01 M) and acetonitrile (1:1, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) for TC and OTC at 355 nm with different retention times. The method had an acceptable precision with good linearity, specificity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, and stability. Among a total of 252 raw samples, approximately 68.25%, 25.4%, and 7.54% contained CIP, TC, and OTC, respectively. Out of the positive raw samples, CIP exceeded the maximum residual limit (MRL) in 3.6% muscle, 14.3% liver and 17.9% skin samples, whereas TC and OTC were below the MRLs. The residual concentrations of these antibiotics were almost unchanged in frozen samples. After boiling the chicken samples, the TC and OTC residues were reduced significantly compared to CIP. Although the concentrations of CIP in boiled samples were above the MRL set by the European Union, these did not exceed the hazard index 1. Based on these results, the exposure levels to antibiotics in broiler chicken meats may be considered to have a low risk for human health.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[China is one of the highest producers of poultry meat output in the world, with a large scale of chicken rearing. Statistically analyzed H9N2-subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have become the dominant subtype in China's live poultry market, with the highest detection rate. Although H9N2 AIV is of low pathogenicity and tends not to cause serious disease and high mortality in poultry, it poses a great challenge to the domestic poultry farming industry by causing a decrease in appetite, a decline in egg production, and deaths caused by mixed infections with another pathogenic microorganism. Moreover, novel influenza viruses (H7N9 and H3N8) infecting humans have emerged in China, and the H9N2 AIV provides all or part of the internal genes to the new recombinant viruses, posing a potential threat to public health and safety and human health. In this research, six H9N2 AIVs were isolated from feces or oropharyngeal swabs collected from live poultry markets and duck farms in Zhanjiang. After epidemiological investigations, phylogenetic analyses, and molecular characterization, we found that the ZJ81 strain was a chicken-human-mink recombinant virus, the ML3 strain was a chicken-human recombinant virus, and all six virus strains of the virus had a bias for the human receptor-binding site and a mutation that could cause an increase in virulence in mice. Therefore, surveillance and control of H9N2 AIV should be strengthened to provide data support for cross-species transmission of H9N2 AIV., H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has low-pathogenicity but causes respiratory symptoms and drop in egg production in chicken with long-term virus shedding, resulting in great economic losses due to high mortality related to secondary infection with other pathogens. In recent years, H9N2 viruses have been posing a threat to public health, causing human infection in China. Compared to studies on other AIV subtypes, there are relatively few studies on the pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus in mammals. H9N2 subtype AIV has been circulating worldwide in many avian species and transmitting with high efficiency in poultry. It can provide internal genes for other subtypes to produce new viruses, causing a pandemic risk. It is important to carry out long-term surveillance and pathogenic characteristics of the H9N2 virus. In this study, we conducted environmental surveillance of live poultry markets in Anhui province from 2013 to 2018, and 33 representative environmental isolates were selected and studied systematically. The genomic RNA of Anhui H9N2 isolates was subjected to RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing analysis. Thirty-three strains were isolated from the embryonated eggs of specific-pathogen-free chickens. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that h9.4.2.5-like H9N2 viruses were predominant during 2013-2018 and acquired multiple specific amino acid mutations that may have increased their affinity for mammals and enhanced their infectivity and transmissibility. Additionally, six internal genes of H9N2 clustered together with the novel human-lethal reassortant viruses, such as the low-pathogenicity H7N9, H10N8, and Anhui H5N6 viruses, and even HPAI H7N9. Because H9N2 viruses may be the donors of internal genes that lead to the generation of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced pathogenicity in Anhui province, continuous environmental surveillance of live poultry markets, a key source of reassorted H9N2 and other avian influenza viruses, is of great importance., H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has low-pathogenicity but causes respiratory symptoms and drop in egg production in chicken with long-term virus shedding, resulting in great economic losses due to high mortality related to secondary infection with other pathogens.

       "0  [Poultry is thriving across the globe. Chicken meat is the most preferred poultry worldwide, and its popularity is increasing. However, poultry also threatens human hygiene, especially as a fomite of infectious diseases caused by the major foodborne pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Listeria). Preventing pathogenic bacterial biofilm is crucial in the chicken industry due to increasing food safety hazards caused by recurring contamination and the rapid degradation of meat, as well as the increased resistance of bacteria to cleaning and disinfection procedures commonly used in chicken processing plants. To address this, various innovative and promising strategies to combat bacterial resistance and biofilm are emerging to improve food safety and quality and extend shelf-life. In particular, natural compounds are attractive because of their potential antimicrobial activities. Natural compounds can also boost the immune system and improve poultry health and performance. In addition to phytochemicals, bacteriophages, nanoparticles, coatings, enzymes, and probiotics represent unique and environmentally friendly strategies in the poultry processing industry to prevent foodborne pathogens from reaching the consumer. Lactoferrin, bacteriocin, antimicrobial peptides, cell-free supernatants, and biosurfactants are also of considerable interest for their prospective application as natural antimicrobials for improving the safety of raw poultry meat. This review aims to describe the feasibility of these proposed strategies and provide an overview of recent published evidences to control microorganisms in the poultry industry, considering the human health, food safety, and economic aspects of poultry production., Food borne diseases are one of the major human disease conditions worldwide. Most of them are of bacterial origin and chickens are a major source of such bacteria; they are consumed at high rate worldwide and tend to harbor the zoonotic bacteria without showing signs of illness. Running rain water tends to increase environmental contamination, since it carries various substances from one area to another; this results in village-indigenous chickens picking more bacteria from the environment as they roam/scavenge around for food. Thus, after the rain, the chickens' intestinal contents may contain more bacteria quantity-wise and type-wise. This study was carried-out to determine whether that was the case after heavy rains of 2018.120 intestine samples were collected from indigenous chickens from three slaughterhouses in Nairobi for bacterial quantification using the Miles and Misra technique; bacterial isolation and identification were carried out using standard bacteriological procedures. Intestines from the slaughterhouses had different mean bacterial counts: Kangemi had the highest (1.3 × 10<sup>12</sup> colony-forming units per ml), followed by Burma (5.6 × 10<sup>11</sup>), then Kariokor (4.7 × 10<sup>11</sup>). <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> was the most isolated at 85.8%, followed by genera <i>Staphylococcus</i> (55%), <i>Streptococcus</i> (43.3%), <i>Bacillus</i> (41.66%), <i>Listeria</i> (38.3%), <i>Proteus</i> (24.16%), <i>Klebsiella</i> (7.5%), <i>Campylobacter</i> (2.5%), <i>Pseudomonas</i> (6%), and <i>Streptobacillus</i> (0.83%). The study showed that the indigenous chickens carry a variety of bacteria in types and numbers, some of them being zoonotic. Apart from picking more bacteria as a result of environmental contamination during rainy season, the weather and bird-handling further stress the birds, thus contributing to higher bacterial multiplication and higher bacterial carriage. If slaughter is not done right, these intestinal bacteria can easily cause contamination of respective chicken meat; thus, if pathogenic, it can cause food poisoning to consumers of the meat. Therefore, it is recommended that precaution be taken while slaughtering chickens for consumption. In addition, where possible, free-range indigenous chickens be confined during rainy seasons to reduce their exposure to contaminated environment., Salmonellosis, caused by <i>Salmonella</i> species, is one of the most common foodborne illnesses worldwide with an estimated 93.8 million cases and about 155,00 fatalities. In both industrialized and developing nations, Salmonellosis has been reported to be one of the most prevalent foodborne zoonoses and is linked with arrays of illness syndromes such as acute and chronic enteritis, and septicaemia. The two major and most common <i>Salmonella</i> species implicated in both warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals are <i>Salmonella bongori</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica.</i> To date, more than 2400 <i>S. enterica</i> serovars which affect both humans and animals have been identified. <i>Salmonella</i> is further classified into serotypes based on three primary antigenic determinants: somatic (O), flagella (H), and capsular (K). The capacity of nearly all <i>Salmonella</i> species to infect, multiply, and survive in human host cells with the aid of their pathogenic and virulence arsenals makes them deadly and important public health pathogens. Primarily, food-producing animals such as poultry, swine, cattle, and their products have been identified as important sources of salmonellosis. Additionally, raw fruits and vegetables are among other food types that have been linked to the spread of <i>Salmonella</i> spp. Based on the clinical manifestation of human salmonellosis, <i>Salmonella</i> strains can be categorized as either non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> (NTS) and typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i>. The detection of aseptically collected <i>Salmonella</i> in necropsies, environmental samples, feedstuffs, rectal swabs, and food products serves as the basis for diagnosis. In developing nations, typhoid fever due to <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi typically results in the death of 5%-30% of those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) calculated that there are between 16 and 17 million typhoid cases worldwide each year, with scaring 600,000 deaths as a result. The contagiousness of a <i>Salmonella</i> outbreak depends on the bacterial strain, serovar, growth environment, and host susceptibility. Risk factors for <i>Salmonella</i> infection include a variety of foods; for example, contaminated chicken, beef, and pork. Globally, there is a growing incidence and emergence of life-threatening clinical cases, especially due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Salmonella</i> spp, including strains exhibiting resistance to important antimicrobials such as beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins. In extreme cases, especially in situations involving very difficult-to-treat strains, death usually results. The severity of the infections resulting from <i>Salmonella</i> pathogens is dependent on the serovar type, host susceptibility, the type of bacterial strains, and growth environment. This review therefore aims to detail the nomenclature, etiology, history, pathogenesis, reservoir, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, risk factors, antimicrobial resistance, public health importance, economic impact, treatment, and control of salmonellosis.]  \n",

Because poultry is considered a major source of Campylobacter infections in humans, reduction of Campylobacter contamination in poultry products is likely the most important and effective public health strategy for reducing the burden of campylobacteriosis in humans. A comprehensive on-line survey was conducted of key stakeholders in the U.S. broiler industry, including broiler farm managers (n = 18), poultry veterinarians (n = 18), and processing plant managers (n = 20), to assess the current pre- and postharvest Campylobacter interventions and control measures practiced by the industry for reducing Campylobacter contamination of broiler products. The survey also included information regarding each respondent's understanding of Campylobacter transmission and ecology in relation to broiler production. The results revealed that a majority of the establishments included in the survey are following the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service guidelines for controlling Campylobacter contamination in broiler flocks and on carcasses. However, establishments appeared to be putting more effort into Salmonella control than into Campylobacter control both on the farm and in the processing plant. A majority of the respondents responded that current interventions are not effective for reducing Campylobacter contamination, especially on the farm. Many respondents did not understand the risk factors associated with Campylobacter colonization in broiler flocks and on carcasses. Continued educational and training programs for key stakeholders in the U.S. broiler industry are needed to increase awareness of the issues associated with Campylobacter infection in broiler chickens and of the fact that Campylobacter infection is a multifaceted problem that requires efforts from both the pre- and postharvest sectors., <i>Campylobacter</i> is a major foodborne pathogen and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been described worldwide. The main objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and AMR of <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. isolated from broilers throughout the supply chain in Valencia, Spain. A total of 483 samples were included in the analysis: 430 from the slaughterhouse (chicken carcass and neck skin) and 53 from the point of sale (retail broiler and packaging). Taking into account the origin of the sample, the prevalence of <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. was 19% in carcass, 28.2% in neck skin, 36.7% in retail broiler, and 80% in packaging isolates. The prevalence of different species in the analyzed samples was 21.1% and 4.8% for <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> and <i>Campylobacter coli</i>, respectively. AMR profiling of 125 <i>Campylobacter</i> isolates revealed that 122 (97.6%) of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. <i>C. jejuni</i> samples presented high resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, 96.1% and 90.2% respectively, whereas <i>C. coli</i> showed 87% of resistance to both antimicrobials. Both species were resistant to tetracycline (<i>C. jejuni</i> 84.3% and <i>C. coli</i> 60.9%) and 26.1% of <i>C. coli</i> was resistant to streptomycin. These results showed no significant difference in the frequency of AMR (<i>p</i> ≥ 0.05) among isolates originated from different points in the food-processing chain at slaughterhouses and retail establishments. In contrast, three main patterns were detected: quinolone-tetracycline (64%), quinolone-only (17.6%), and quinolone-tetracycline-aminoglycosides (8%). Additionally, 12.8% of the isolates presented multidrug resistance, with significantly higher levels detected among <i>C. coli</i> (30.4%) isolates compared with <i>C. jejuni</i> (8.8%) and all the three strains were resistant to all six antibiotics tested. Therefore, these results indicate that broilers could be a source of antimicrobial-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> in humans and consequently pose a risk to public health., <i>Campylobacter</i> is the most frequent foodborne zoonotic bacteria worldwide, with chicken meat being overwhelmingly the most important reservoir for human infections. Control measures implemented at the farm level (i.e., biosecurity or vaccination), which have been successfully applied to limit other pathogens, such as <i>Salmonella</i>, have not been effective in reducing <i>Campylobacter</i> occurrence. Thus, new approaches are needed to fully understand the ecological interactions of <i>Campylobacter</i> with host animals to effectively comprehend its epidemiology. The objective of this study was to analyse longitudinally the gut microbiota composition of <i>Campylobacter</i>-infected and non-infected farms to identify any difference that could potentially be indicative of gut colonization by <i>Campylobacter</i> spp. Differences in the colonization rate and timing were observed at the farms that became positive for <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> over the investigated time points, even though in positive tests, the occurrence of <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> gut colonization was not observed before the second week of the life of the birds. Significant differences were observed in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa between the microbiota of individuals belonging to farms that became <i>Campylobacter</i> positive during the study and those who remained negative with particular reference to <i>Bacteroidales</i> and <i>Clostridiales</i>, respectively. Moreover, <i>Campylobacter</i> colonization dramatically influenced the microbiota richness, although to a different extent depending on the infection timing. Finally, a key role of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> genera on the <i>Campylobacter</i> microbial network was observed. Understanding the ecology of the <i>Campylobacter</i> interaction with host microbiota during infection could support novel approaches for broiler microbial barrier restoration. Therefore, evidence obtained through this study can be used to identify options to reduce the incidence of infection at a primary production level based on the targeted influence of the intestinal microbiota, thus helping develop new control strategies in order to mitigate the risk of human exposure to <i>Campylobacter</i> by chicken meat consumption.]  \n",

Multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates with high adaptability, have been responsible for many foodborne disease outbreaks. Here we present an investigation on the contamination and the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in retail meat obtained from supermarkets and from open markets in Guangxi, China. From the years 2009 to 2016, a total of 604 Salmonella isolates were recovered from a total of 3340 meat samples including 797 beef, 911 pork, 942 chicken and 690 duck, representing 18.08% of the samples tested. Pork was the most contaminated meat. Salmonella was detected in 322 samples from supermarkets and the positive rate of 21.03% was higher than that of 15.70% in 284 samples from open markets (P<0.05). The prevalence of Salmonella in retail meat in the summer and fall months: June (2015, 40.63%), October (2012, 34.6%; 2016, 43.75%) was higher than in other seasons of the year. One hundred and twenty-seven serotypes were identified among the 604 Salmonella enterica isolates, and S. Derby (28.48%), S. Agona (9.77%), S. London (4.97%) and S. Enteritidis (4.47%) were the most common serotypes. Tests of susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents showed that 87.58% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and 57.79% exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR), as they were resistant to at least three antimicrobials. The presence of most of the antimicrobial-resistant genes tested was consistent with the resistant phenotypes found. Among all the antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs) examined in this study, bla<sub>TEM-1</sub>, aadA1, cmlA, tetA, sul1 and sul2 were the most prevalent resistant genes in the multidrug resistant isolates. Our findings show that there was a trend that the Salmonella contamination in retail meat had increased and isolates showed an MDR phenotype and that the MDR had become more and more serious. Twenty-one isolates of S. Agona were randomly analyzed by using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) and six different types were found, indicating the existence of cross-contamination in the food market. The results indicate that the hazard analysis of the critical control points (HACCP) system for the whole food chain of retail meat should be further analyzed and improved., This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates. High levels of Salmonella contamination were detected in pork (67.0%), duck (50.5%) and chicken (46.2%). Thirty different serotypes were identified among 500 detected Salmonella isolates, as well as significant differences in serotypes between different retail meat samples. Notably, 405 (80.1%) isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). Meanwhile, we also found that 74 (14.8%) Salmonella isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the major mechanisms underlying this resistance were investigated. The commonest mutations in gyrA S83F (40.5%) and D87N (35.1%), and in parC was T57S (71.6%) and S80I (35.1%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that the S. Kentucky isolates that were resistant to ciprofloxacin mostly belonged to ST198 (21/23, 91.3%) and PFGE revealed the presence of various genotypes. This study identified a diversity of Salmonella serotypes and a high prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, which indicates that foodborne Salmonella potentially constitutes a potential food safety risk., This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail meat in Southern China, and to characterize the major mechanisms that mediate the ciprofloxacin resistance of isolates.

The focus of this study was the health risk assessment of consumers from the determination of ciprofloxacin (CIP), tetracycline (TC), and oxytetracycline (OTC) in broiler chicken in the raw, frozen, and boiled stages using solid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and ultraviolet detection (SPE-HPLC-UV). Chromatographic separation was achieved using 0.3% metaphosphoric acid and acetonitrile (1:10, <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) for CIP at 280 nm and oxalic acid (0.01 M) and acetonitrile (1:1, <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) for TC and OTC at 355 nm with different retention times. The method had an acceptable precision with good linearity, specificity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, and stability. Among a total of 252 raw samples, approximately 68.25%, 25.4%, and 7.54% contained CIP, TC, and OTC, respectively. Out of the positive raw samples, CIP exceeded the maximum residual limit (MRL) in 3.6% muscle, 14.3% liver and 17.9% skin samples, whereas TC and OTC were below the MRLs. The residual concentrations of these antibiotics were almost unchanged in frozen samples. After boiling the chicken samples, the TC and OTC residues were reduced significantly compared to CIP. Although the concentrations of CIP in boiled samples were above the MRL set by the European Union, these did not exceed the hazard index 1. Based on these results, the exposure levels to antibiotics in broiler chicken meats may be considered to have a low risk for human health., In a market environment where food safety problems still occur despite repeated prohibitions, food safety problems caused by veterinary drug residues and biological safety problems caused by the transfer of drug resistance have attracted much attention. Herein, a method based on a compound purification system coupled with direct analysis in real time-tandem mass spectrometry (DART-MS/MS) was established to determine 41 different types of veterinary drug residues in livestock and poultry products. First, a single-standard solution sampling method was used to optimize the selection of the best quasi-molecular ion, two daughter ions, and their cone-hole and collision voltages; qualitative and quantitative ion pairs are composed of a quasi-molecular ion and its corresponding daughter ion. The abundance ratios of the drug compounds in standard solutions of the solvent and matrix mixtures were then calculated according to the requirements of the European Union 2002/657 specification. DART-MS/MS was subsequently developed for the accurate characterization and quantitative analysis of the veterinary drugs. Finally, a composite purification pretreatment system was formed by combining the primary secondary amine (PSA) and octadecyl bonded silica gel (C18) of a QuEChERS technology with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to achieve the one-step purification of the drug compounds. The influence of the key parameters of the DART ion source on the determination of the drugs was investigated using the peak areas of the quantitative ions as the criterion. The optimum conditions were as follows: ion source temperature of 350 ℃, 12-Dip-it Samplers module, sample injection speed of 0.6 mm/s, and external vacuum pump pressure of -75 kPa. According to the differences in the dissociation constant (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>) ranges of the 41 types of veterinary drug compounds and the characteristics of the sample matrixes, the extraction solvent, matrix-dispersing solvent, and purification method were optimized based on the recovery. The extraction solvent was 1.0% acetonitrile formate solution, and the pretreatment column included MWCNTs containing 50 mg of PSA and 50 mg of C18. The three chloramphenicol drugs showed a linear relationship in the ranges of 0.5-20 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9995-0.9997,and the detection and quantification limits of three chloramphenicol drugs were 0.1 and 0.5 μg/kg, respectively. The 38 other drugs, including quinolones, sulfonamides, and nitro-imidazoles showed a linear relationship in the ranges of 2-200 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9979-0.9999, and the detection and quantification limits of the 38 other drugs were 0.5 and 2.0 μg/kg, respectively. The recoveries of the 41 veterinary drugs at low, medium, and high spiked levels in chicken, pork, beef, and mutton samples were 80.0%-109.6%, with intra- and inter-day precisions of 0.3%-6.8% and 0.4%-7.0%, respectively. A total of 100 batches of animal meat (pork, chicken, beef, and mutton; 25 batches each) and known positive samples were simultaneously analyzed using the national standard method and the detection method established in this study. Sulfadiazine (89.2, 78.1, and 105.3 μg/kg) was detected in three batches of pork samples, and sarafloxacin (56.3, 102.0 μg/kg) was detected in two batches of chicken samples and no veterinary drugs were detected in the other samples; both methods yielded consistent results for known positive samples. The proposed method is rapid, simple, sensitive, environmentally friendly, and suitable for the simultaneous screening and detection of multiple veterinary drug residues in animal meat., The misuse of antibiotics in poultry farming is a global issue.

Statistically analyzed H9N2-subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have become the dominant subtype in China's live poultry market, with the highest detection rate. Although H9N2 AIV is of low pathogenicity and tends not to cause serious disease and high mortality in poultry, it poses a great challenge to the domestic poultry farming industry by causing a decrease in appetite, a decline in egg production, and deaths caused by mixed infections with another pathogenic microorganism. Moreover, novel influenza viruses (H7N9 and H3N8) infecting humans have emerged in China, and the H9N2 AIV provides all or part of the internal genes to the new recombinant viruses, posing a potential threat to public health and safety and human health. In this research, six H9N2 AIVs were isolated from feces or oropharyngeal swabs collected from live poultry markets and duck farms in Zhanjiang. After epidemiological investigations, phylogenetic analyses, and molecular characterization, we found that the ZJ81 strain was a chicken-human-mink recombinant virus, the ML3 strain was a chicken-human recombinant virus, and all six virus strains of the virus had a bias for the human receptor-binding site and a mutation that could cause an increase in virulence in mice. Therefore, surveillance and control of H9N2 AIV should be strengthened to provide data support for cross-species transmission of H9N2 AIV., H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has low-pathogenicity but causes respiratory symptoms and drop in egg production in chicken with long-term virus shedding, resulting in great economic losses due to high mortality related to secondary infection with other pathogens. In recent years, H9N2 viruses have been posing a threat to public health, causing human infection in China. Compared to studies on other AIV subtypes, there are relatively few studies on the pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus in mammals. H9N2 subtype AIV has been circulating worldwide in many avian species and transmitting with high efficiency in poultry. It can provide internal genes for other subtypes to produce new viruses, causing a pandemic risk. It is important to carry out long-term surveillance and pathogenic characteristics of the H9N2 virus. In this study, we conducted environmental surveillance of live poultry markets in Anhui province from 2013 to 2018, and 33 representative environmental isolates were selected and studied systematically. The genomic RNA of Anhui H9N2 isolates was subjected to RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing analysis. Thirty-three strains were isolated from the embryonated eggs of specific-pathogen-free chickens. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that h9.4.2.5-like H9N2 viruses were predominant during 2013-2018 and acquired multiple specific amino acid mutations that may have increased their affinity for mammals and enhanced their infectivity and transmissibility. Additionally, six internal genes of H9N2 clustered together with the novel human-lethal reassortant viruses, such as the low-pathogenicity H7N9, H10N8, and Anhui H5N6 viruses, and even HPAI H7N9. Because H9N2 viruses may be the donors of internal genes that lead to the generation of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced pathogenicity in Anhui province, continuous environmental surveillance of live poultry markets, a key source of reassorted H9N2 and other avian influenza viruses, is of great importance., H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) has low-pathogenicity but causes respiratory symptoms and drop in egg production in chicken with long-term virus shedding, resulting in great economic losses due to high mortality related to secondary infection with other pathogens.

Thirty-three strains were isolated from the embryonated eggs of specific-pathogen-free chickens. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that h9.4.2.5-like H9N2 viruses were predominant during 2013-2018 and acquired multiple specific amino acid mutations that may have increased their affinity for mammals and enhanced their infectivity and transmissibility. Additionally, six internal genes of H9N2 clustered together with the novel human-lethal reassortant viruses, such as the low-pathogenicity H7N9, H10N8, and Anhui H5N6 viruses, and even HPAI H7N9. Because H9N2 viruses may be the donors of internal genes that lead to the generation of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced pathogenicity in Anhui province, continuous environmental surveillance of live poultry markets, a key source of reassorted H9N2 and other avian influenza viruses, is of great importance.]  "
